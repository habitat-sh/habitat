Use [Test Kitchen](https://kitchen.ci/) to automatically test cookbooks
across any combination of platforms and test suites:

-   Test suites are defined in a kitchen.yml file. See the
    [configuration](/workstation/config_yml_kitchen/) documentation for options
    and syntax information.
-   Supports cookbook testing across many cloud providers and
    virtualization technologies.
-   Uses a comprehensive set of operating system base images from Chef's
    [Bento](https://github.com/chef/bento) project.
