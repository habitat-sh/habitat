This command has a built in process supervisor that ensures all of the
required services are in the appropriate state at any given time. The
supervisor starts two processes per service and provides the following
subcommands for managing services: `hup`, `int`, `kill`, `once`,
`restart`, `service-list`, `start`, `status`, `stop`, `tail`, and
`term`.
