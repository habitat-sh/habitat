Chef Habitat Builder acts as the core of Chef's Application Delivery Enterprise hub.
It provides a repository for all available Chef Habitat packages built by Chef and the supporting community, as well as search and an API for clients.

You can store application plans on the Chef Habitat Builder SaaS where the Chef Habitat community can view and access them. You can also deploy the [on-prem version of Chef Habitat Builder](https://github.com/habitat-sh/on-prem-builder) where you can store and maintain your apps in a secure environment.
