An origin is a unique namespace in Chef Habitat Builder where you can store, share, and build packages.
Once created, an origin cannot be renamed, but it can be deleted or transferred.
For example, the _core_ origin contains foundational packages managed and versioned by the core Chef Habitat maintainers.

You can join existing origins by invitation or create your own origins in an on-prem Habitat Builder deployment. For details about invitations, see [origin membership and RBAC]({{< relref "origin_rbac.md#origin-membership" >}}).
