The Chef Habitat multi-channel refresh approach provides a structured methodology for managing package updates, dependencies, and maintenance cycles across different channels. This approach ensures consistent, reliable package delivery while minimizing disruption to production environments.

## Overview

A multi-channel refresh strategy allows organizations to:

- Manage package dependencies across multiple channels (unstable, dev, staging, stable)
- Coordinate refresh cycles between interdependent packages
- Implement controlled rollout strategies with proper testing gates
- Maintain package freshness while ensuring stability
- Handle complex dependency chains efficiently

## Channel Hierarchy and Refresh Flow

### Standard Channel Flow

Chef Habitat follows a standard channel promotion flow:

```
unstable → dev → staging → stable
```

Each channel serves a specific purpose in the refresh cycle:

- **unstable**: Latest builds, automated testing
- **dev**: Development integration, feature testing  
- **staging**: Pre-production validation, performance testing
- **stable**: Production-ready packages

### Multi-Channel Refresh Strategy

The multi-channel approach coordinates refreshes across this hierarchy:

1. **Upstream Refresh**: Monitor and pull updates from upstream dependencies
2. **Build Propagation**: Automated builds cascade through channels
3. **Dependency Coordination**: Ensure compatible dependency versions across channels
4. **Validation Gates**: Quality gates between channel promotions

## Refresh Rules and Policies

### Automatic Refresh Rules

#### Core Package Refresh
- **Frequency**: Daily for unstable, weekly for stable
- **Scope**: Security patches, critical bug fixes
- **Trigger**: Upstream dependency updates, CVE notifications

#### Dependency Refresh
- **Upstream Dependencies**: Monitor external package repositories
- **Internal Dependencies**: Coordinate with other Habitat packages
- **Version Constraints**: Respect semantic versioning rules

#### Security Refresh
- **Critical CVEs**: Immediate refresh across all channels
- **Security Patches**: Expedited promotion through channels
- **Compliance Requirements**: Maintain security patch currency

### Manual Refresh Triggers

Organizations may need manual refresh controls for:
- Breaking changes requiring coordination
- Major version upgrades
- Custom testing requirements
- Business-critical timing constraints

## Environment Variables for Multi-Channel Control

### HAB_REFRESH_CHANNEL
Controls the default channel for dependency resolution during package builds:

```bash
# Set refresh channel for builds
export HAB_REFRESH_CHANNEL=dev

# Build with specific refresh channel
HAB_REFRESH_CHANNEL=staging hab pkg build
```

### HAB_REFRESH_STRATEGY
Define refresh behavior for multi-channel environments:

```bash
# Conservative refresh - manual approval required
export HAB_REFRESH_STRATEGY=manual

# Progressive refresh - automated with gates
export HAB_REFRESH_STRATEGY=progressive

# Aggressive refresh - immediate propagation
export HAB_REFRESH_STRATEGY=immediate
```

### HAB_REFRESH_COORDINATION
Enable coordination between related package refreshes:

```bash
# Coordinate with dependent packages
export HAB_REFRESH_COORDINATION=enabled

# Specify coordination group
export HAB_REFRESH_GROUP=web-stack
```

## Maintenance Cycles

### Weekly Maintenance Windows

**Purpose**: Regular package refresh and dependency updates

**Schedule**: 
- Unstable: Continuous integration
- Dev: Tuesday maintenance window
- Staging: Wednesday maintenance window  
- Stable: Thursday maintenance window

**Activities**:
- Dependency version updates
- Security patch application
- Performance optimization updates
- Documentation updates

### Monthly Stability Cycles

**Purpose**: Major version updates and architectural changes

**Schedule**: First full week of each month

**Activities**:
- Major dependency upgrades
- Breaking change coordination
- Comprehensive testing cycles
- Cross-package integration validation

### Quarterly Release Cycles  

**Purpose**: Strategic feature releases and major updates

**Schedule**: Aligned with business quarters

**Activities**:
- Feature milestone releases
- Major architectural changes
- Ecosystem-wide coordinated updates
- Long-term stability validation

## Package Refresh Request Guidelines

### Standard Refresh Requests

For routine package refresh requests:

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate update necessity and impact
2. **Planning**: Identify dependencies and coordination requirements
3. **Testing**: Validate updates in lower environments
4. **Coordination**: Notify stakeholders of planned refresh
5. **Execution**: Perform refresh with proper monitoring
6. **Validation**: Confirm successful refresh across environments

### Emergency Refresh Procedures

For critical security or bug fix refreshes:

1. **Immediate Assessment**: Evaluate severity and urgency
2. **Fast-Track Process**: Expedited testing and validation
3. **Stakeholder Notification**: Immediate communication to affected teams
4. **Coordinated Deployment**: Synchronized refresh across environments
5. **Post-Refresh Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring during stabilization

### Refresh Request Documentation

All refresh requests should include:
- **Justification**: Why the refresh is needed
- **Impact Analysis**: Affected packages and services
- **Testing Plan**: Validation strategy for the refresh
- **Rollback Plan**: Recovery strategy if issues arise
- **Timeline**: Proposed schedule with dependencies
- **Stakeholders**: Teams and individuals to notify

## Multi-Channel Configuration Examples

### Basic Multi-Channel Setup

```toml
# habitat-refresh.toml
[refresh]
strategy = "progressive"
coordination = true

[channels]
unstable = { auto_refresh = true, frequency = "continuous" }
dev = { auto_refresh = true, frequency = "daily" }
staging = { auto_refresh = false, frequency = "weekly" }
stable = { auto_refresh = false, frequency = "monthly" }

[dependencies]
upstream_monitoring = true
security_scanning = true
version_constraints = "semantic"
```

### Complex Dependency Coordination

```toml
# Complex multi-service refresh coordination
[refresh_groups.web_stack]
packages = ["nginx", "app-server", "database"]
coordination_mode = "sequential"
validation_required = true

[refresh_groups.data_pipeline]
packages = ["kafka", "spark", "elasticsearch"]
coordination_mode = "parallel"
dependency_order = ["kafka", "elasticsearch", "spark"]
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Refresh Metrics

Track key metrics for multi-channel refresh operations:
- **Refresh Success Rate**: Percentage of successful refreshes
- **Refresh Duration**: Time to complete refresh cycles  
- **Dependency Resolution Time**: Time to resolve complex dependencies
- **Channel Promotion Velocity**: Speed of promotion through channels

### Alerting and Notifications

Configure alerts for refresh anomalies:
- Failed refresh attempts
- Dependency resolution failures
- Security patch delays
- Channel promotion blockages

### Audit and Compliance

Maintain comprehensive audit logs:
- Refresh request approvals
- Channel promotion history
- Security patch compliance
- Dependency update tracking

## Best Practices

### Refresh Planning
- **Coordinate Dependencies**: Plan refreshes considering dependent packages
- **Test Thoroughly**: Validate refreshes in non-production environments
- **Communicate Clearly**: Notify stakeholders of refresh plans and impacts
- **Monitor Actively**: Watch for issues during and after refreshes

### Channel Management
- **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure consistent package versions within channels
- **Respect Promotion Gates**: Don't skip validation steps between channels
- **Document Changes**: Maintain clear change logs for channel promotions
- **Automate Safely**: Use automation for routine refreshes, manual for complex changes

### Dependency Management
- **Version Pinning**: Pin critical dependencies to known-good versions
- **Security Priority**: Prioritize security updates over feature updates
- **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate downstream impacts before major updates
- **Rollback Readiness**: Always have rollback plans for refresh operations

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Dependency Resolution Conflicts
```bash
# Check dependency conflicts
hab pkg dependencies <package> --channel <channel>

# Force refresh with specific versions
HAB_REFRESH_CHANNEL=stable hab pkg install <package>/<version>
```

### Channel Promotion Failures
```bash
# Validate package before promotion
hab pkg verify <package>/<version>

# Check channel permissions
hab origin <origin> channels
```

### Refresh Coordination Problems
```bash
# Check coordination group status
hab pkg refresh-status --group <group_name>

# Manual coordination reset
hab pkg refresh-reset --coordination-group <group_name>
```

## Integration with CI/CD Pipelines

### Automated Refresh Integration

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: Multi-Channel Refresh
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1'  # Weekly Monday 2 AM
  
jobs:
  refresh-unstable:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Refresh unstable packages
        run: |
          hab pkg refresh --channel unstable --strategy progressive
          
  promote-to-dev:
    needs: refresh-unstable
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Promote to dev channel
        run: |
          hab pkg promote <package> unstable dev --auto-refresh
```
