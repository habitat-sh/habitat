Each core package undergoes a maintenance cycle during a package refresh. This process determines whether multiple major or minor versions of the package are available.

Package version refreshes are categorized into the following maintenance cycles:

- **Single major, one minor (so):** One major version with a single minor version.
- **Single major, multiple minor (sm):** One major version with multiple minor versions.
- **Multiple major, one minor (mo):** Multiple major versions with a single minor version.
- **Multiple major, multiple minor (mm):** Multiple major versions with multiple minor versions.
