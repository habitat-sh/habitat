## Chef-owned origins

Progress Chef maintains the following origins:

- **core**: Hosts packages for common dependencies and compilers maintained by Progress Chef.
- **chef**: Hosts packages for Chef products like Chef Infra Client, Chef InSpec, and Chef Automate.
- **chef-platform**: Hosts packages for Chef 360 Platform skills.
- **habitat**: Hosts packages required for an on-prem Habitat Builder deployment.

## Where can I create an origin

You can create origins with [Habitat On-Prem Builder](/habitat/on_prem_builder/).
You can't create origins in [Chef's public Habitat Builder SaaS](https://bldr.habitat.sh).
