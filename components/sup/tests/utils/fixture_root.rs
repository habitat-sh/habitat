//! Returns the directory root for fixtures for this integration
//! test. Each integration test module should have a fixture directory
//! with the same name as the module.
//!
//! Thus for an integration test module named `foo.rs`, you would put
//! your fixtures all in the `/components/sup/tests/fixtures/foo`
//! directory, and then call `FixtureRoot::new("foo")` in your test.
//!
//! Currently our fixtures are limited to testing packages. We have
//! `*.spec` files and package directories, which you can think of as
//! minimal expanded Habitat artifacts.
//!
//! For example, the current fixtures for the `compilation` test suite
//! are as follows:
//!
//!       $ ls -1 components/sup/tests/fixtures/compilation
//!       config-changes-hooks-do-not
//!       config-changes-hooks-do-not.spec
//!       config-only
//!       config-only.spec
//!       hook-changes-config-does-not
//!       hook-changes-config-does-not.spec
//!       no-changes-no-restart
//!       no-changes-no-restart.spec
//!       no-configs-only-hooks
//!       no-configs-only-hooks.spec
//!
//! We have a number of directories representing testing packages,
//! along with their corresponding spec files. A representative
//! directory looks like this:
//!
//!       tests/fixtures/compilation/config-only
//!       ├── config
//!       │   └── config.toml
//!       ├── hooks
//!       │   └── run
//!       └── TARGET
//!
//! They contain only what is needed to a) be recognized by the
//! Supervisor as packages and b) satisfy the needs of their test.
//!
//! In general, each fixture should be used by a single test.
