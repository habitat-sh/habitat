//! Pidfile / Lockfile of the Launcher
//!
//! When the Supervisor starts, it is given the PID of the Launcher that started
//! it. It then writes this PID to `/hab/sup/default/LOCK` (see `path()` below)
//! to serve as a record of the currently-running process. This is used to
//! discover which process to terminate (when running `hab sup term`), and also
//! helps ensure that only one Supervisor process is running at a time.
//!
//! To maintain this exclusivity, we hold a shared file lock on the file for the
//! duration of the Supervisor process. As a Supervisor starts, it attempts to
//! acquire an _exclusive_ lock to that file. It will fail if a Supervisor is
//! already running, because that process' shared lock will prevent acquisition
//! of the exclusive lock.
//!
//! In an ideal world, this file would probably be written by the Launcher
//! itself. However, the file currently resides in the `/hab/sup` directory
//! hierarchy, which the Supervisor is responsible for maintaining.
