///     * No
///         * Can we find any installed BusyBox pacakge?
///             * Yes: use the latest installed BusyBox release & return its `PATH` entries
///             * No
///                 * Is the `busybox` binary present on `$PATH`?
///                     * Yes: return the parent directory which holds the `busybox` binary
///                     * No: out of ideas, so return an error after warning the user we're done
///
/// # Errors
///
/// * If an installed package should exist, but cannot be loaded
/// * If a installed package's path metadata cannot be read or returned
/// * If a known-working package identifier string cannot be parsed
/// * If the parent directory of a located `busybox` binary cannot be computed
/// * If the Supervisor is not executing inside a packge, and if no BusyBox package is installed,
///   and if no `busybox` binary can be found on the `PATH`
