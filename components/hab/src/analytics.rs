//! hab command line interface analytics module.
//!
//! The `hab` command-line tool will optionally send anonymous usage data to Habitat's Google
//! Analytics account. This is a strictly opt-in activity and no tracking will occur unless you
//! respond affirmatively to the question during `hab setup`. If you do not use `hab setup`, no
//! data will ever be sent.
//!
//! We collect this data to help improve Habitat's user experience: for example, to know what tasks
//! users are performing, and which ones they are having trouble with (e.g. mistyping command line
//! arguments).
//!
//! By _anonymous_ we mean that all identifying information about you is removed before we send the
//! data. This includes the removal of any information about what packages you are building, or
//! what origins you are using. For example, if you were building the package `yourname/yourapp`,
//! and you typed `hab pkg build -k yourkey yourname/yourapp`, the fact that you were performing
//! the `pkg build` operation would be transmitted. Neither the name of the specific package you
//! are building, nor the fact that you are using the `yourkey` key to sign that package would be
//! transmitted.
//!
//! Please do not hesitate to [contact us](mailto:support@habitat.sh) if you have questions or
//! concerns about the use of Google Analytics within the Habitat product.
//!
//! Note that this module is highly documented, even inside functions with the intent of guiding a
//! user through the implementation who may not necessarily be familiar with Rust code. Given the
//! "must-not-impact-the-user" nature of this code, it tends to be much more explicit than regular,
//! idiomatic Rust code. But at least you can see a lot of `match` expressions in action :)
//!
//! # Subcommand Invocations
//!
//! The following is a complete list of all pre-selected commands which are reported:
//!
//! * `apply`
//! * `pkg upload`
//! * `cli setup`
//! * `config apply`
//! * `file upload`
//! * `origin key generate`
//! * `pkg build`
//! * `ring key generate`
//! * `service key generate`
//! * `setup`
//! * `studio build`
//! * `studio enter`
//! * `user key generate`
//!
//! # Subcommands Which Attempt Submission of Events
//!
//! The only time events will be sent to the Google Analytics API is when certain subcommands are
//! invoked which require network access. These subcommands are:
//!
//! * `apply`
//! * `pkg upload`
//! * `cli setup`
//! * `config apply`
//! * `file upload`
//! * `install`
//! * `origin key upload`
//! * `pkg install`
//! * `setup`
//!
//! For all other subcommands, even those which report events, the event payload is saved to a
//! cached file under the analytics cache directory (`/hab/cache/analytics` for a root user and
//! `$HOME/.hab/cache/analytics` for a non-root user).
//!
//! # Event Data Breakdown
//!
//! For each event that is reported, a set of information is bundled into the payload. Here is a
//! breakdown of each key/value entry:
//!
//! ## `v=1`
//!
//! The [Protocol Version][pv] which is currently only ever the integer value of `1`.
//!
//! [pv]: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#v
//!
//! ## `tid=UA-XXXXXXX-X`
//!
//! The [Tracking ID][ti]
//! which represents this product and is currently hard coded as `"UA-6369228-7"`.
//!
//! [ti]: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#tid
//!
//! ## `cid=f673faaf-6ba1-4e60-b819-e2d51e4ad6f1`
//!
//! The [Client ID][ci] which is a randomly generated [UUID v4][uuid] and written into the system
//! or user's analytics cache (`/hab/cache/analytics/CLIENT_ID` when the program is invoked as the
//! root user and `$HOME/.hab/analytics/CLIENT_ID` when invoked by a non-root user). This is not
//! intended to track individual users or systems, but rather show patterns of usage in aggregate.
//! For example: "In general, users who generally start with `hab studio enter` tend to migrate to
//! using `hab pkg build` over time".
//!
//! [ci]: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#cid
//! [uuid]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_.28random.29
//!
//! ## `t=event`
//!
//! The [Hit Type][ht].  This value is hard coded as `"event"` as it is a required Google Analytics
//! field for all Hit Events.
//!
//! [ht]: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#t
//!
//! ## `aip=1`
//!
//! Enables [Anonymize IP][ai].  This entry ensures that the sender's IP address will not be
//! captured and will be anonymized.  The value is hard coded as the integer `1`.
//!
//! [ai]: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#aip
//!
//! ## `an=hab`
//!
//! The [Application Name][an] of the program sending the event. For this program the value is
//! currently hard coded as `"hab"`.
//!
//! [an]: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#an
//!
//! ## `av=0.6.0%2F20160604180457`
//!
//! The [Application Version][av] of the program sending the event. This version string will be the
//! same value as reported when asking for the program's version on the command line. Note that
//! this field may contain characters that must be percent encoded.
//!
//! [av]: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#av
//!
//! ## `ds=cli--hab`
//!
//! The [Data Source][ds] which represents the program which generated the event data. For this
//! program the value is currently hardcoded as `"cli--hab"`.
//!
//! [ds]: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#ds
//!
//! ## `ec=invoke`
//!
//! The [Event Category][ec] which corresponds to the type of event being sent. Currently there are
//! only 2 possible values: `"invoke"` for subcommand invocations and `"clierror"` for CLI errors.
//!
//! [ec]: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#ec
//!
//! ## `ea=hab--pkg--build`
//!
//! The [Event Action][ea] which breaks down differently depending on the type of event. For
//! subcommand invocations (where `"ec=invoke"`), the value is the subcommand invoked with no
//! further arguments, options, or flags. Any spaces are replaced with a doubledash, as in:
//! `"hab--studio--enter"` or `"hab--artifact--upload"`. For CLI errors (where `"ec=clierror"`),
//! the value is the type of CLI error followed by a double dash and terminated with the subcommand
//! which was invoked (also containing no further arguments, options, or flags). As before any
//! spaces in the subcommand are replaced with a double dash, as in:
//! `"InvalidSubcommand--hab-whoops"`.
//!
//! [ea]: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#ea
//!
//! # User-Agent HTTP Header
//!
//! A user agent string is also included in the HTTP/POST to the Google Analytics API it is of the
//! form:
//!
//! ```text
//! <PRODUCT>/<VERSION> (<TARGET>; <KERNEL_RELEASE>)
//! ```
//!
//! where:
//!
//! * `<PRODUCT>`: is the provided product name. For this program the value is currently hard coded
//!   as `"hab"`.
//! * `<VERSION>`: is the provided version string which may also include a release number. This is
//!   the same version obtained when running the help or version subcommands.
//! * `<TARGET>`: is the machine architecture and the kernel separated by a dash in lower case.
//! * `<KERNEL_RELEASE>`: is the kernel release string from `uname`.
//!
//! For example:
//!
//! ```text
//! hab/0.6.0/20160606153031 (x86_64-darwin; 14.5.0)
//! ```
