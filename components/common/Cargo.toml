# The handlebars crate has a few issues that require us to lock at 0.28.3
# until further notice.
#
# - 0.30.0 bumps to a version of the `pest` crate that fails to build
#   on Windows.
# - 0.29.0 makes a change to array processing that is incompatible
#   with our templating syntax; we use "foo[0]", but it now requires
#   "foo.[0]"
#   See https://github.com/sunng87/handlebars-rust/commit/707f05442ef6f441a1cfc6b13ac180b78cb296db
