//! Encapsulates code to perform the equivalent of `chmod -R g=u` on a
//! directory.
//!
//! This is needed in order to ensure that the `/hab` directory in a
//! BuildRoot is constructed such that the root group has write
//! permissions, allowing containerized Habitat services to run as
//! non-root users, which is necessary for running in platforms like
//! OpenShift and various HPC situations.
//!
//! Because Docker does not yet provide the ability within a
//! Dockerfile to perform an `ADD` or `COPY` command while also
//! setting permissions on those files, we must set the permissions on
//! the files _before_ they are pulled into the container. We could
//! add a `RUN chmod -R g=u /hab` in the Dockerfile, but that
//! essentially doubles the size of any container, due to how Docker's
//! layered filesystem works. The approach here takes more code, but
//! results in a better experience for end-users.
//!
//! Also note that this is currently a no-op on Windows, since
//! permissions work differently over there, and we don't have
//! non-root Habitat supervisors there either.
