# TODO: In order to support certain customers who are still using Windows 7 until
# January 2024, it is necessary to freeze the version of this crate at 0.15.0. 
# Newer versions of this crate use a Windows syscall called 'GetOverlappedResultEx',
# which is not supported on versions of Windows prior to 8. 
# For more information about 'GetOverlappedResultEx', please refer to the following documentation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-getoverlappedresultex
# The commit that introduced the change can be found here: https://github.com/servo/ipc-channel/commit/eb08381a30bc71a534a0a73ab98c05bca7a12f82
