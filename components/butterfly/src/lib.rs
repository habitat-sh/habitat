//! Butterfly is the [SWIM](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/Quicksilver/public_pdfs/SWIM.pdf)
//! implementation for Habitat, along with a ZeroMQ based gossip protocol.
//!
//! It implements SWIM+Susp+Inf. It uses Newscast-style "heat" tracking to share membership rumors,
//! while trying to keep UDP packet sizes below 512 bytes. It has the following changes:
//!
//! 1. It uses a single membership rumor with internal logic for applying the rumors state, rather
//!    than sending differential event messages.
//! 1. If an "Alive" membership rumor is received with a higher incarnation, it takes precedent over
//!    "Confirmed" membership rumors.
//! 1. Members can be marked "persistent", which means that they will always be taken through the
//!    Probe cycle, regardless of their status. This allows networks to heal from partitions.
//!
//! The SWIM implementation has three working threads:
//!
//! 1. An inbound thread, handling receipt of SWIM messages.
//! 1. An outbound thread, which handles the Ping->PingReq cycle and protocol timing.
//! 1. An expire thread, which handles timing out suspected members.
//!
//! The Gossip implementation has two working threads:
//!
//! 1. A 'push' thread, which fans out to 5 members every second (or longer, if it takes longer than
//!    1 second to send all the messages to all the members in the fan-out; no more frequently than
//!    one second).
//! 1. A 'pull' thread, which takes messages from any push source and applies them locally.
//!
//! Start exploring the code base by following the thread of execution in the `server` module.
