//! # Builder database design
//!
//! The database is designed to scale vertically, but is set up to allow for
//! horizontal partitioning in the future.
//!
//! The tables are denormalized. Rather than follow the typical 3-4nf style, we
//! accept duplication of data in order to ensure speedy retrieval.
//!
//!   * Database activity is driven by stored procedure; no raw queries in normal
//!     course of events.
//!   * The application itself is responsible for the schema; mirgrations are in diesel,
//!     and any service that needs it can upgrade the database.
//!   * Roll forward schema changes only. You can add columns, you can migrate data,
//!     but you can't remove columns.
//!   * All tables must include `created_at` and `updated_at`, as they are
//!     automatically managed
//!
//! The `builder-db` module provides the backend for all database access - it provides:
//!
//! * Connection pooling
//! * Migrations
//! * Code for checking the migrations of registered backends
//! * Shared test harness for crates that consume it
//!
//! In individual services, you implement a data_store module, which defines the
//! schema, the procedures, the migrations, and the wrapper functions allowing your
//! service handlers to work.
//!
//! ## A sidebar about stored procedures
//!
//! We drive much of the database access through stored procedures. It's controversial - we get it.
//! Here is why we're doing it:
//!
//! 1. We want extensive test coverage of the database, and its migrations. It's a requirement.
//! 1. We want the service itself to handle migrations at boot. It's automatic.
//! 1. Versioned stored procedures will enforce several of the above rules - the big one being that
//!    only append-style migrations are allowed to tables. If you try and build a migration that
//!    breaks a query, the migration will fail inside its transaction, with the database being
//!    unharmed.
//! 1. Access to the database through the stored procedure calls means we can use the same functions
//!    for maintenance as required.
//! 1. We can ensure that a release of the service that manages a database component uses only the
//!    functions it was designed for - when the service upgrades, it gets the upgraded functions.
//!    Rollbacks will work cleanly.
//! 1. In postgresql, and plpgsql function is automatically prepped by the query parser and
//!    analyzer. This means that, in general, they are as fast as a prepared statement, all the
//!    time, without having to actually build a prepared statement per-connection.
//!
//! Answers to common questions:
//!
//! 1. Q: Isn't this a lot of ceremony? A: Yes. We think its worth it.
//! 1. Q: I don't know plpgsql. A: That's not a question. It's not hard. You learned Rust to get
//!    here :)
//! 1. Q: Won't this impact database performance? A: Probably, but in a positive way. Think about
//!    it - 99% of the time, you run the same queries all the time. This is the equivalent of
//!    having them prepared in advance for you all the time.
//! 1. Q: But what about those horror stories? A: The horror stories are about encoding your
//!    business logic in the database. For example, doing complex transformations on the data, or
//!    map reducing it, or all kinds of other crazy business. Both our application and our access
//!    patterns mean we likely won't need to do a whole lot of that.
