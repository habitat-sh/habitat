# Builder-Graph

`bldr-graph` is a tool for building and querying the reverse dependency graph of
Habitat packages. It is intended to be used primarily by Habitat developers.

The tool connects to the builder-scheduler Postgres DB in order to construct the
graph. The database can be optionally specified and passed in a config file.

## Features

* Interactive shell
* Query the forward dependencies of a package
* Query the reverse dependency graph of a given package
* Find the top packages that have the highest number of reverse dependencies
* Find the fully qualified package names from a given search phrase
* Print statistics about the reverse dependency graph
* Check new package dependencies for version conflicts

## Usage

To use it, do the following:

```
$ bldr-graph [<path to config file>]
```

Once the tool starts up and completes reading the graph, it will
present some basic stats and the open an interactive shell for commands.

Example run:

```
$ bldr-graph
