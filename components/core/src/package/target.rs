//! System architecture representation.
//!
//! This module provides one primary type, [`PackageTarget`], which is the public representation of
//! a package (artifact, installed, or abstract) which has been built to run on a particular system
//! and architecture.
//!
//! A [`PackageTarget`] is similar in nature to [Rust's target triple][rust_triple] which comes
//! from [Clang's target triple][clang_triple], however we only require 2 pieces of information
//! from the triple concept:
//!
//! 1. The target architecture such as `x86_64`, `i386`, `armv7`, etc.
//! 2. The target system which maps to a generic concept of an operating  system, although more
//!    specifically the target kernel such as `linux`, `darwin`, `freebsd`, etc.
//!
//! An optional third piece of information, a variant, may be included in a package target as an
//! informational means of differentiating otherwise identical architecture/system combination
//! values.
//!
//! Internally, a [`PackageTarget`] is represented using the type system resulting in type safety
//! and static certainty while providing only one string representation for each type when
//! serializing and deserializing. So while at the edges of the system we may be dealing with
//! strings such as `x86_64-windows` in web requests, metadata files, etc., a small, safe
//! representation will be stored in memory and passed around.
//!
//! # Determining Package Target
//!
//! At build time, the build system will produce a Habitat artifact which is unconditionally
//! encoded with a specific package target by including a `TARGET` metafile in the root of the
//! package's installed directory. For convenience, the package target string representation is
//! also used in the naming of the so-called "hart" file (or Habitat ARTifact).
//!
//! After a package has been built, there are a few ways to check the [`PackageTarget`]:
//!
//! * Checking an artifact can be done by calling the [`target`][archive_target] method on
//! [`PackageArchive`].
//! * Checking that an installed package's target matches the active target is done automatically
//! when calling the [`load`][install_load] or [`load_at_least`][install_load_at_least] functions
//! on [`PackageInstall`].
//!
//! # A Special Note Concerning Variants
//!
//! The optional variant does **not** correspond to a `<vendor>` or `<abi>` as taken from a
//! traditional target triple (another reason why this concept is called a "package target" in
//! Habitat and not a "target triple"). In particular, the traditional understanding of [ABI]
//! doesn't fully apply where it relates to [C standard library][libc] implementations as multiple
//! libc implementations can live alongside each other within one package target set of packages.
//! For example, in the `x86_64-linux` package target there already exists a mature and default
//! [Glibc] toolchain and a minimal but effective [musl] toolchain which co-exist in the core
//! origin's package set. This fact however doesn't rule out future package targets which may use
//! the variant portion of a [`PackageTarget`] to represent custom or specific CPU/FPU support
//! which is distinct from the default, variant-less package target type.

// Generates an `enum` called `Type` which has a variant for each and every explicitly supported
// package target type. A public constant for each supported target is created containing full
// documentation. An internal constant is also generated containing all supported `PackageTarget`
// types. This constant is exposed via a `PackageTarget::targets` function. Finally, a function
// called `active_package_target` is also generated which determines the package target for the
// compiled version of this code.
//
// Adding a new target entry below will allow new package targets to be supported by any code
// consuming this crate.
//
// The structure for each target entry is as follows:
//
// 1. The string representation of the target type which will be used to derive the `as_str` and
//    `from_str` implementations. The format of this string must follow the structure outlined in
//    this module's documentation. The string is also used as a configuration predicate that
//    conditionally compiles the symbols needed for the target. A feature should be added to the
//    `Cargo.toml` with the same name.
// 2. The Rust variant identifier which will be used in `Type`. For example, `Type::X86_64_Linux`.
// 3. The Rust constant identifier which will be used to construct a public constant for each
//    supported target.
// 4. The Rust string value to be used in the target's `cfg!(target_arch = "<arch>")` macro. This
//    will be used to conditionally compile the correct and appropriate active package target at
//    compile time.
// 5. The Rust string value to be used in the target's `cfg!(target_os = "<arch>")` macro. This will
//    be used to conditionally compile the correct and appropriate active package target at compile
//    time.
//
// Note that some package targets may overlap on the same underlying `target_arch`/`target_os`
// system. These are still distinct and exclusive package targets and will operate in isolation as
// much as possible if more than one installed package target is present on the same system. Again,
// the third and fourth values are used by the Rust compiler at build time and never exposed in
// code at runtime.
