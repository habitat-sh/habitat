//! Habitat core encryption and cryptography.
//!
//! This module uses [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium) and its Rust counterpart
//! [sodiumoxide](https://github.com/dnaq/sodiumoxide) for cryptographic operations.
//!
//! # Concepts and terminology:
//!
//! - All public keys, certificates, and signatures are to be referred to as **public**.
//! - All secret or private keys are to be referred to as **secret**.
//! - All symmetric encryption keys are to be referred to as **secret**.
//! - In general, the word `key` by itself does not indicate something as
//! **public** or **secret**. The exceptions to this rule are as follows:
//!     - if the word key appears in a URL, then we are referring to a public key to
//!       conform to other API's that offer similar public key downloading functionality.
//!     - the word `key` appears as part of a file suffix, where it is then considered as
//!       a **secret key** file.
//! - Referring to keys (by example):
//!     - A key name: `habitat`
//!     - A key rev: `201603312016`
//!     - A key name with rev: `habitat-201603312016`
//!     - A key file: `habitat-201603312016.pub`
//!     - A key path or fully qualified key path: `/foo/bar/habitat-201603312016.pub`
//! - An **Origin** refers to build-time operations, including signing and verifification of a
//! Habitat artifact.
//! - An **Organization** or **Org** refers to run-time operations such as deploying a package
//! signed in a different origin into your own organization. This is abbreviated as "org" in
//! user-facing command line parameters and internal variable names.
//! - To distinguish between **Org** and **Origin**, the following might help: Habitat packages
//! come from an **Origin** and run in an **Organization**.
//! - A **Ring** is the full set of Supervisors that communicate with each other.
//! - A **Signing key**, also known as a **sig** key, is used to sign and verify Habitat artifacts.
//! The file contains a `sig.key` file suffix. Note that sig keys are not compatible with box keys.
//! - A **Box key** is used for encryption and decryption of arbitrary data. The file contains a
//! `.box.key` file suffix. Note that box keys are not compatible with sig keys.
//! - A **Sym key** is used for symmetric encryption, meaning that a shared secret is used to
//! encrypt a message into a ciphertext and that same secret is used later to decryt the ciphertext
//! into the original message.
//! - A **Ring key** is a **sym** key used when sending messages between the Supervisors to prevent
//! a third party from intercepting the traffic.
//! - **Key revisions** - There can exist several keys for any given user, service, ring, or origin
//! via different revision numbers. Revision numbers appear following the key name and are in the
//! format `{year}{month}{day}{hour24}{minute}{second}`. For all user-facing cryptographic
//! operations (such as sign, verify, encrypt, decrypt, etc.), the latest key is tried first, and
//! upon failure, the keys will be tred in reverse chronological order until success or there are
//! no more keys.
//!
//! ***TODO: key revisions are generated as part of a filename, but only the most recent key is
//! used during crypto operations.***
//!
//! # Key file naming
//!
//! ## Origin key
//!
//! ```text
//! <origin_name>-<revision>.pub
//! <origin_name>-<revision>.sig.key
//! ```
//!
//! Example origin key file names ("sig" keys):
//!
//! ```text
//! habitat-201603312016.pub
//! habitat-201603312016.sig.key
//! your_company-201604021516.pub
//! your_company-201604021516.sig.key
//! ```
//!
//! ## User key
//!
//! ```text
//! <user_name>-<revision>.pub
//! <user_name>-<revision>.box.key
//! ```
//!
//! Example user keys ("box" keys)
//!
//! ```text
//! dave-201603312016.pub
//! some_user-201603312016.pub
//! ```
//!
//! ## Service key
//!
//! ```text
//! <service_name>.<group>@<organization>-<revision>.pub
//! <service_name>.<group>@<organization>-<revision>.box.key
//! ```
//!
//! Example Service keys:
//!
//! ```text
//! redis.default@habitat-201603312016.pub
//! ```
//!
//! ## Ring key
//!
//! ```text
//! <ring_name>-<revision>.sym.key
//! ```
//!
//! Example Ring keys:
//!
//! ```text
//! staging-201603312016.sym.key
//! ```
//!
//! # File fomats
//!
//! ## Habitat artifacts
//!
//! A signed Habitat artifact (a file with the extention `.hart`) has 5 plaintext lines followed by
//! a binary blob of data, which is an unsigned, compressed tarfile. The lines are as follows:
//!
//! 1. The artifact format version
//! 1. The name with revision of the origin key which was used to sign the artifact
//! 1. The hashing algorithm used, which at present is only `BLAKE2b`, but may expand in the future
//! 1. A Base64 *signed* value of the binary blob's Base64 file hash
//! 1. The last line is left empty, meaning that 2 newline characters (`\n`) separate the header
//!    from the payload
//!
//! The remainder of the file is a compressed tarball of the contents to be extracted on disk. At
//! present, the tarball is compressed using `xz` but is considered an implementation detail. Also
//! note unlike the format of keys, the compressed tarball is **not** Base64 encoded--it is the
//! compressed tarball itself.
//!
//! Note that the BLAKE2b hash functions use a digest length of 32 bytes (256 bits!). More details
//! about the hashing strategy can be found in the [libsodium hashing
//! documentation](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/hashing/generic_hashing.html).
//!
//! Signing uses a secret origin key, while verifying uses the public origin key. Thus, it it safe
//! to distribute public origin keys.
//!
//! Example header:
//!
//! ```text
//! HART-1
//! habitat-20160405144945
//! BLAKE2b
//! signed BLAKE2b signature
//!
//! <binary-blob>
//! ```
//!
//! Due to the simple, line-driven structure of the header it's possible to examine the contents of
//! a Habitat artifact using standard Unix tooling:
//!
//! ```text
//! $ head -4 /path/to/acme-glibc-2.22-20160310192356-x86_64-linux.hart
//! HART-1
//! habitat-20160405144945
//! BLAKE2b
//! abc123...
//! ```
//!
//! Note that the `abc123` would be a Base64 string in a real file.
//!
//! It's also possible to extract a plain compressed tarball from a signed Habitat artifact using
//! the `tail(1)` Unix command:
//!
//! ```text
//! tail -n +6 /tmp/somefile.hart > somefile.tar.xz
//! ```
//!
//! The above command starts streaming the file to standard out at line 6, skipping the first 5
//! plaintext lines.
//!
//! If the Habitat artifact needs to be extracted on disk without verifying its integrity or
//! authenticity, this can be accomplised with:
//!
//! ```text
//! tail -n +6 /tmp/somefile.hart | xzcat | tar x -C /
//! ```
//!
//! **Caution!** Working with Habitat artifacts in this manner this is not normally recommended and
//! is **not** a supported workflow for working with Habitat artifacts--they are signed for very
//! important reasons.
//!
//! ## Encrypted payloads
//!
//! The first 4 lines of an encrypted payload are as follows:
//!
//! 1. The encrypted format version
//! 1. The key name, including revision of the source user
//! 1. The key name, including revision of the recipient service
//! 1. A nonce, in Bas64 format.
//! 1. The encrypted message in Bas64 format.
//!
//! ```text
//! BOX-1
//! signing key name
//! recipient key name
//! nonce_base64
//!
//! <ciphertext_base64>
//! ```
//!
//! ## Ring keys
//!
//! There are 3 lines, that is 3 parts that are separtated by a newline character `\n`. They are as
//! follows:
//!
//! 1. Encrypted format version
//! 1. The ring key name, including revision
//! 1. The key itself, which is Bas64-encoded
//!
//! ```text
//! SYM-1
//! staging-20160405144945
//!
//! <symkey_base64>
//! ```
