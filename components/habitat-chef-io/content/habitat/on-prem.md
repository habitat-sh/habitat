In addition to our hosted service, we also support installing and running a Chef Habitat Builder Depot on-premises, using your own network and infrastructure, which allows you to choose from a wider selection of authentication providers and to manage how Builder fits into your existing CI/CD processes.

Currently, our on-premises Builder depot only stores packages for download and upload by Supervisors and Studios. We intend to bring the full capabilities of Chef Habitat Builder to our on premises option in the future.

For a detailed explanation of features, requirements and setup instructions, [see the GitHub repository](https://github.com/habitat-sh/on-prem-builder).
