Habitat 0.67.0 Release notes

We are happy to announce the release of Habitat 0.67.0. If you just want the binaries, head on over to [Install Habitat](https://www.habitat.sh/docs/install-habitat/).

In this release, we have a new `hab pkg uninstall` command you'll want to check out. More will be coming for this highly-requested command in the coming weeks, but it should help you begin to take control of your `/hab/pkgs` directory.

Aside from that, we have a number of bug fixes, in particular [#5792](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/pull/5792), which fixed a regression from 0.66.0 that resulted in health check information remaining behind after a service was unloaded.

Thanks again for using Habitat!
