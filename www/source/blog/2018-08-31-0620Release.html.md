Habitat 0.62.0 Release Notes

We are happy to announce the release of Habitat 0.62.0. We have a number of new features as well as bug fixes, so please read on for all the details. If you just want the binaries, head on over to [Install Habitat](https://www.habitat.sh/docs/install-habitat/). Thanks again for using Habitat!

### New Features & Enhancements

* Shut down the supervisor (but not services) when SIGHUP is received [#5445](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/pull/5445) ([baumanj](https://github.com/baumanj)). This allows for the same no-service-downtime upgrades to the supervisor as auto-updating does, but allows the user to manually control what supervisor version is installed and when.

* Implement binlink for Windows [#5513](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/pull/5513) ([mwrock](https://github.com/mwrock)). Habitat will create “binstub” batch files in `C:\hab\bin` that will invoke the target executable in the binlinked package. Unless a specific binary is specified, binstubs will be created for all files with an extension included in the PATHEXT environment variable. `C:\hab\bin` will be automatically added to the `PATH` of a Habitat Studio. The `hab setup` command can be used to add it to the local machine `PATH`.

### Behavioral Changes

* Add a supervisor version requirement checked by the launcher [#5484](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/pull/5484) ([baumanj](https://github.com/baumanj)). Launcher updates do not happen by default, but should you upgrade to this version, it will require that the supervisor it launches be v0.56 or later. See [issue 5300](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/issues/5300) for more.
