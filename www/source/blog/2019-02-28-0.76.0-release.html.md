Full Changelog:

#### Behavioral Changes
- Update ChannelIdent to use env::Config::configured_value where appropriate [#6169](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/pull/6169) ([baumanj](https://github.com/baumanj))

#### Bug Fixes
- fix array handling on windows scaffolding [#6228](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/pull/6228) ([mwrock](https://github.com/mwrock))
  Note: This change to windows scaffolding is to align it with implementation of the Linux scaffolding.  The expectation is that scaffolding should be a single item, however in windows it is currently implemented as an array. This will be a breaking change if you are using windows scaffolding with more than one package in `$pkg_scaffodling()`,  as we now only take into account the first item in that array.
