## Release Notes Highlights:

* Run Chef Habitat as non-root
* **Potentially breaking change, depending on how you've automated your build pipeline** New Tar Exporter: slightly different command, includes the Chef Habitat Launcher package by default
* Chef Habitat and Windows: read all about it!
* Powershell 6.0 released: Update Windows Launcher and Supervisor
* Released: `hab plan init --windows`
* Chef Habitat Launcher: new version released, please update
* Github Project re-organization

* Windows Developers/Release Engineers: Windows documentation for Chef Habitat is now at parity in all our tutorials! [Get started here.](https://www.habitat.sh/docs/install-habitat/#install-habitat)

Please note: these release notes and deeper dives into the features over the next few days will all be available in more blog posts.

## Run Chef Habitat as non-root

Historically, the Chef Habitat Supervisor on Linux has always required `root` privileges to run. When running workloads on scheduler platforms like Kubernetes and OpenShift, however, it is not always desirable, or perhaps even possible, to run containers as `root`. This has made it impossible to run Chef Habitat-built containers in a vanilla OpenShift installation, for example. With this release of the Chef Habitat Supervisor, however, the need to run as `root` has been removed. The
Supervisor will continue to operate as it always has if it is run as `root`, but it can now modify its behavior when run as a user with lower privileges. This unlocks Chef Habitat usage for a wider variety of users and use-cases.

* Supervisor should not require root [\#4525](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/pull/4525)

## **Potentially breaking change** New Tar Exporter: slightly different command, includes hab launcher by default

Need to export your Chef Habitat package as a tar archive?  We’ve just released a new tar exporter! The tar archives contain everything needed to run the package - including Chef Habitat itself and all dependencies.  Although Chef Habitat had an existing tar exporter, it was written in bash (which made it difficult if not impossible to use on Windows) and did not include the Chef Habitat Launcher package, which is required to launch the Supervisor and dependent services.  This release includes a rewrite of the tar exporter in Rust - which makes it much more usable across platforms - and adds in a launcher to every tar export.  To export a hart package as a tar archive, run

```shell
$ hab pkg export tar origin/package_name
```

Then, upload it to wherever you wish to run it.  Unpackage it to your root filesystem with

```shell
$ sudo tar xf your_tar.tar.gz -C /
```

Then add in the hab group and user

```shell
$ sudo adduser --group hab
$ sudo useradd -g hab hab
```

Then, to run your package as a service, just run

```shell
$ sudo /hab/bin/hab start origin/package_name
```

Your service and all dependencies will be running!

## Powershell 6.0 released: Update Windows Launcher and Supervisor

Powershell Core 6.0 has been officially released and the latest Windows Supervisor updates its dependency to use it. Powershell Core 6.0 changed the binary name of Powershell to pwsh.exe. In order to ensure that run hooks launched by the Windows Supervisor version 0.53.0 and later use the pwsh.exe binary, you will want to update your Chef Habitat Launcher process. This is as simple as running “hab pkg install core/hab-launcher” on the same machine that is running the Supervisor. This Launcher is compatible with older Supervisors so it is advisable to update the launcher prior to updating the Supervisor.

* fallback to older powershell binary name if newer one is not installed [\#4540](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/pull/4540

## Released: `hab plan init --windows`

Chef Habitat’s “plan init” command can now generate Powershell based plans. Use the `--windows` flag to generate a plan.ps1 file instead of a plan.sh file with `hab plan init --windows <your_pkg_name>`.

- Implement `hab plan init` for Powershell plans [\#4527](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/issues/4527)
- adding a `--windows option` for `hab plan init` to generate powershell plan [\#4528](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/pull/4528)

## Chef Habitat Launcher: new version released, please update

This release of Chef Habitat includes a new release of the Launcher, a small binary that the Supervisor uses to help manage its supervised processes. Whereas the Supervisor is able to automatically update itself, the Launcher is currently released a bit differently, by design; it should be rare that the Launcher ever needs to change. To update your Launchers, you will need to run `hab pkg install core/hab-launcher` on each machine that has a Supervisor, and then restart your Supervisor. This will, by necessity, require a restart of supervised services, so factor that into your planning.

While we always recommend using the latest code, this Launcher is of particular interest for the following two use cases:  

If you wish to run the Supervisor on Linux as a non-root user _that is anonymous_ (i.e., has no named entry in `/etc/passwd`), you will need the new Launcher. (Note that container exports will automatically include the latest version of the Launcher with no additional actions on your part.)

On the other hand, if you are on Windows, you will also need the new Launcher, since the 0.53.0 Supervisor uses Powershell 6.0.0 and older Launchers will not invoke the newly-renamed `pwsh.exe` binary and therefore call the system installed version of Powershell instead of the Chef Habitat packaged Powershell.

If neither scenario applies to you, updating the Launcher is not strictly required at this time, but please plan to update at your earliest convenience.

## Github Project Re-organization

Our Changelog is less useful than normal this release because we've reached the stage of project where it's time to split components into their own repos - so there are a bunch of issues that have been closed in the habitat-sh/habitat repo, and recreated in a more specific repo (e.g. habitat-sh/builder). You can see all the current repos here - [https://github.com/habitat-sh](https://github.com/habitat-sh/) - and don't hesitate to ask questions via Github Issues, the [Chef Habitat Slack](http://slack.habitat.sh/), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/habitatsh).
