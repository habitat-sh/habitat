# Get Habitat

To get started with Habitat, you only need the `hab` binary.

* <a href="/downloads/hab.zip">Mac OS X</a>
* <a href="/downloads/hab.gz">Linux</a>
* Microsoft Windows - coming soon

If you are using Mac OS X and intend to build Habitat packages, you also need to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).

Habitat is an open-source project. You can also browse the Habitat repo on GitHub at [https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat). However, you do not need to clone the source code in order to use Habitat.
