# Get Habitat
To get started with Habitat, you only need to download the `hab` command-line interface tool at [download site]().

If you are using Mac OS X and intend to build Habitat packages, you also need to install the [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox).

If you are running a Linux distribution such as Ubuntu on your host machine, you also need to install the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/linux/) CLI tool.

Habitat is an open-source project. You can also browse the Habitat repo on GitHub at [https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat); however, you do not need to clone the source code in order to use Habitat.
