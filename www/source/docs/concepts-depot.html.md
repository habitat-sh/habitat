# Depot

A service for storing Habitat packages for download and upload.

Private depots are in the works but currently only the public depot is supported. You may explore the public depot via its web interface at [https://app.habitat.sh](https://app.habitat.sh)

In addition to viewing packages, you may use the origins pane to manage your origins, optionally uploading your public org key via the webui rather than the `hab origin key upload` command.
