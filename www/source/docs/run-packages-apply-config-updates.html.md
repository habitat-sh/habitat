# Apply configuration updates to a service group
Similar to specifying updates to individual settings at runtime, you can apply multiple configuration changes to an entire service group at runtime using stdin from your shell or through a TOML file. These configuration updates can be sent in the clear or encrypted in gossip messages through [wire encryption](/docs/run-packages-security#wire-encryption).

> Note: Wire encryption secures all traffic between supervisors in a ring that possess a ring key; however, if a supervisor has the ring key, it can read any configuration content passed around the ring.

## Usage
When submitting a configuration update to a service group, you must specify a peer in the ring to connect to, the version number of the configuration update, and the new configuration itself. Configuration updates can be either TOML passed into stdin, or passed in a TOML file that is referenced in `hab config apply`.

Configuration updates for service groups must be versioned. The version number must be an integer that starts at one and must be incremented with every subsequent update to the same service group. If the version number is less than or equal to the current version number, the change(s) will not be applied.

Here are some examples of how to apply configuration changes through both the shell and through a TOML file.

**Stdin**

       echo 'buffersize = 16384' | hab config apply --peer 172.17.0.3 myapp.prod 1

**TOML file**

      hab config apply --peer 172.17.0.3 myapp.prod 1 /tmp/newconfig.toml

  > Note: The filename of the configuration file is not important.

    Your output would look something like this:

       » Applying configuration
       ↑ Applying configuration for myapp.prod into ring via ["172.17.0.3:9634"]
       Joining peer: 172.17.0.3:9634
       Configuration applied to: 172.17.0.3:9634
       ★ Applied configuration.

    The services in the myapp.prod service group will restart according to the service group's [update strategy](/docs/run-packages-update-strategy).

      Writing new file from gossip: /hab/svc/myapp/gossip.toml
      hab-sup(SC): Updated config.json
      myapp(SV): Stopping
      hab-sup(SV): myapp - process 981 died with signal 15
      hab-sup(SV): myapp - Service exited
      myapp(SV): Starting
      ...
