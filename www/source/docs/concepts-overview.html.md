# Concepts
Habitat is comprised of plan and build system, a supervisor, an HTTP interface on that supervisor to report package status, a depot, a communication model for disseminating rumors through a supervisor ring, and many other components.

This section will delve into each of these major components to give you a better idea of what they are, what they do, and how they work together. For information about the underlying design goals that motivated these components, see [Why Habitat?](/about/).

You can also see Habitat's reference architectures at [Habitat Infographics](/docs/reference/habitat-infographics/)
