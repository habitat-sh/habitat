title: How to run packages

# Run packages

Habitat packages used to start services are run under the Habitat supervisor. At runtime, you can join supervisors together in a service group running the same topology, send configuration updates to that group, and more. You can also export the supervisor together with the package to an external immutable format, such as a Docker container.

## Running single packages for testing

Packages can be tested in the interactive studio environment or natively on a host machine running Linux.

When entering an interactive studio, a supervisor is started for you in the background. To run packages inside of this supervisor:

1. [Build your package](/docs/create-packages-build) inside an interactive studio. Do not exit the studio after it is built.
2. To start your service in the running supervisor, type `hab sup start yourorigin/yourname`, substituting the name and origin of the package you built in step 1. Your service should now be running.

Because the supervisor is running in the background, you will not see the supervisor output as you start your service. However you can use the `sup-log` (supervisor log) command that will stream the tail of the supervisor output.

If your host machine is running Linux, do the following to run your packages:

* Add the `hab` user and group.

      sudo adduser --group hab
      sudo useradd -g hab hab

* Run the `hab` CLI as root.

      sudo hab start yourorigin/yourname


## Running packages in any environment

The `hab` program can also be installed on servers. It will retrieve the necessary components (like the current release of the supervisor) in order to run packages. Thus, you can start the supervisor on any compatible system. As the supervisor can run more than one service (for more details, see the [multiple services](/docs/run-packages-multiple-services) page), only one is necessary per host.

To start the supervisor, you can write an init script or a systemd unit file. For example, for systemd:

      [Unit]
      Description=The Habitat Supervisor

      [Service]
      ExecStart=/bin/hab sup run

      [Install]
      WantedBy=default.target

Next use `hab svc load` to load one or more services into the supervisor for permanent supervision. Using the example from above:

      sudo hab svc load yourorigin/yourname

## Running a package on a virtual machine (VM) 

After you have built the hart package

      1) Spin up a Virtual Machine 
      2) SCP the hart package from your local workstation onto the virtual machine (you can also use FTP or whatever tool you use to copy things from your local workstation to a remote server)
      3) SSH into the virtual machine
      4) In the virtual machine - run these commands

            * Install Habitat

             `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/habitat-sh/habitat/master/components/hab/install.sh | sudo bash`

            * Install the package (which should be on the virtual machine)

            `sudo hab install your_package.hart`

            * Create the Habitat group

            `sudo groupadd hab`
            `sudo useradd -g hab hab`

            * Start the package

            `sudo hab start your_origin/your_package`

And it should run just fine!
