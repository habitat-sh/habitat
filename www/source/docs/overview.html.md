title: Habitat Docs - Overview

# Overview

Habitat centers application configuration, management, and behavior around the application itself, not the infrastructure that the app runs on. This allows Habitat to be deployed and run on various infrastructure environments, such as bare metal, VM, containers, and PaaS.

The Habitat documentation is broken out into the following sections:

- [Tutorials](/tutorials): Location for our getting started and advanced tutorials. Currently, only the getting started tutorial is available. You should start here if you are new to Habitat.
- [Concepts](/docs/concepts-overview): Describes the major components of Habitat and how they work.
- [Create packages](/docs/create-packages-overview): Learn how to create a plan, what all of the plan settings are, and how to configure a package.
- [Build packages](/docs/build-packages-overview): Learn how to sign and build a package, and understand what a package actually contains.
- [Run packages](/docs/run-packages-overview): Learn how to run a package natively as well as through an external runtime format, such as a Docker or rkt container.
