# Export a package
Packages can be exported into multiple external, immutable runtime formats. This topic will be updated as more formats are supported in the future.

## Exporting to Docker

You can create a Docker container image for any package by performing the following steps:

1. Ensure you have a Docker daemon running on your host system. The exporter shares the Docker socket (`unix:///var/run/docker.sock`) into the studio.
2. Create an interactive studio with the `hab studio enter` command.
3. Install or [build](/docs/create-packages-build) the Habitat package from which you want to create a Docker container image, for example:

       hab pkg install yourorigin/yourpackage

4. Run the Docker exporter on the package.

       hab pkg export docker yourorigin/yourpackage

5. You can now exit the studio. The new Docker container image exists on your computer and can be examined with `docker images` or run with `docker run`.

For an example of running a Habitat service in a Docker container, see the [Run your service](/tutorials/getting-started-process-build) step in the Getting Started tutorial.

## Exporting to an Application Container Image (ACI)

You can create an Application Container Image (ACI) for any package by performing the following steps:

1. Create an interactive studio in any directory with the `hab studio enter` command.
2. Install or [build](/docs/create-packages-build) the Habitat package from which you want to create an ACI, for example:

       hab pkg install yourorigin/yourpackage

3. Run the ACI exporter on the package.

       hab pkg export aci yourorigin/yourpackage

4. Note that this will create unsigned ACI images. If you wish to sign your ACI with default options, pass `SIGN=true`:

       SIGN=true hab pkg export aci yourorigin/yourpackage

5. The `.aci` can now be moved to any runtime capable of running ACIs (e.g. [rkt](https://coreos.com/rkt/) on CoreOS) for execution.
