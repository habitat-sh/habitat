# bind = [ "127.0.0.1" ]
# bind = [] - listen on all interfaces

[1;32mHave a look! Scroll to the top of the output and note that the tcp-backlog is set to 511.

[1;36mNot only can the Supervisor report what's configurable, it can actually assist us with changing config items as well.
[1;36mFirst, let's start up a service with a variable override, then we'll see how to apply the same change through the Supervisor.
