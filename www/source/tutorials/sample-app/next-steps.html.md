# You've learned a lot, so what's next?

Thanks for taking some time to get hands-on with Habitat. We hope you're beginning to feel comfortable enough with
the tooling that you can begin placing your apps in a natural Habitat of their own.

In this tutorial you learned how to...

- Create your first plan
- Add a health monitoring hook to your plan
- Build your rails two-tier web application
- Update configuration values dynamically to start the services up successfully
- Uploaded your sample package to the depot

There are many more great features to explore in Habitat! As you venture out, we recommend you keep the following resources at your side. The docs are always being updated and we've got a great community that is ready and willing to help.

- [Habitat Docs](/docs)
- [Habitat Open Source Community](/community)

If you've got the time now, then we recommend you crack open the docs and try your hand at writing a plan for one of you own projects. And if you want to extend the tutorial experience, dive into the [Run packages](/docs/run-packages-overview) section of the docs to start playing with the many runtime features of Habitat.
