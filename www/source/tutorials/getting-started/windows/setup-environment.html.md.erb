# Set up your environment
The `hab` command-line interface (CLI) tool downloads its other components when it needs them, so setup for Habitat is centered on where you want the `hab` CLI installed and getting it integrated into your shell.

1. Open a PowerShell window. Change directory to the directory where you want to place the `hab` CLI and copy the `hab` CLI (and the included DLLs) to that directory.

        mkdir ~/bin
        cp ./where/you/extracted/hab/* -Destination ~/bin

2. Add the location for the `hab` CLI to your `PATH` environment variable.

       $env:PATH += "$env:PATH;$env:USERPROFILE/bin"

    To keep from typing this in for every PowerShell window you use, add the above statement to your PowerShell profile.

3. Run `hab setup` and follow the instructions in the setup script.

   <%= partial "/shared/setup_environment_script_step" %>

   > Note: The GitHub personal access token needs the `user:email` and `read:org` scopes. Habitat uses this for authentication and to determine features based on team membership. Also, you can opt-out of providing usage data at a later point in time by re-running the `hab setup` subcommand and typing `No` when asked if you want to provide usage data.

   For the remainder of the tutorial, we will assume that you are running any command-line steps in Windows PowerShell. 

That's it. You're all set up and ready to create your first package. The first step in that process is to create a plan.
