# Set up your environment
The `hab` command-line interface (CLI) tool downloads its other components when it needs them, so setup for Habitat is centered on where you want the `hab` CLI installed and getting it integrated into your shell.

1.  Open a terminal window. Change directory to the directory where you want to place the `hab` CLI and copy the `hab` CLI to that directory.

        mkdir -p ~/bin
        cp where/you/extracted/hab ~/bin

2. Add the location for the `hab` CLI to your `PATH` environment variable.

       export PATH=$PATH:~/bin

    To keep from typing this in for every terminal window you use, add the above statement to your shell profile.

3. Run `hab setup` and follow the instructions in the setup script.

   > Note: The GitHub personal access token needs the `user:email` and `read:org` scopes. Habitat uses this for authentication and to determine features based on team membership. Also, you can opt-out of providing usage data at a later point in time by re-running the `hab setup` subcommand and typing `No` when asked if you want to provide usage data.

That's it. You're all set up and ready to create your first package. The first step in that process is to create a plan.
