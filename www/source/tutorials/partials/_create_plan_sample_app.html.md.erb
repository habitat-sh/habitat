Creating a plan starts with identifying and referencing the application code that you want to package and automate.
Habitat provides several different ways to refer and include application code in your package: by downloading a tarball
of the source and compiling it when building the package, by referring to a local source directory, or by using a pre-built
binary and bundling it up in your package.

To demonstrate Habitat code residing in the same repo as your source code, you are going to clone a simple Rails web
application and then add your plan to that web application. By having the Habitat plan live in the same directory as your
source code, the Habitat package for your application can be built right alongside your source code for testing and deployment purposes.

## Clone the Project

The Ruby-on-Rails web application in this tutorial is a simple web app that connects to a backend PostgreSQL database. It was created
by running `rails new mywebapp --database=postgresql` to reference the use of PostgreSQL instead of the default database for most Rails
apps, SQLite3. A new root "Hello World" index page and a model were added to the site to support pulling and displaying data from the
PostgreSQL database.

1. Change the default Git for Windows CRLF line endings setting to be LF line endings.

    ```powershell
    PS > git config --global core.eol lf
    PS > git config --global core.autocrlf input
    ```
<% end %>

1. Clone the `habitat-example-plans` repo onto your local machine. In this example, a directory called `habitat-example-plans` will be created
in the `$HOME` directory.

<% if !is_windows %>
    ```console
    $ cd ~
    $ git clone https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat-example-plans
    ```
<% end %>

<% if is_windows %>
    ```powershell
    PS > cd ~
    PS > git clone https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat-example-plans
    ```
<% end%>

1. After you have successfully cloned the repo, change directory to the `myrailsapp` directory.

<% if !is_windows %>
    ```console
    $ cd ~/habitat-example-plans/myrailsapp
    ```
<% end %>

<% if is_windows %>
    ```powershell
    PS > cd .\habitat-example-plans\myrailsapp
    ```
<% end%>

## Start with the Basics

Now that you have cloned the `habitat-example-plans` repo, it is time to define the plan for `myrailsapp`. A plan is a directory comprised
of shell scripts and optional configuration files that define how you download, configure, make, install, and manage the lifecycle of the
software in the Habitat package.

At a bare minimum, a plan must have a `plan.sh` at the root of the directory. This file specifies where the source code or binary is, how
it should be built, and how the supervisor should start it at runtime.

To create your plan, do the following in your terminal window:

1. From within the `myrailsapp` directory, run `hab plan init -s ruby` to create a plan for the `myrailsapp` web application. Because the `myrailsapp` web application is a rails application, specifying `-s ruby` will create a plan that references the Ruby scaffolding.

<% if !is_windows %>
    ```console
    $ hab plan init -s ruby
    ```
<% end %>

<% if is_windows %>
    ~~~powershell
    PS > hab plan init -s ruby
    ~~~
<% end%>

    A scaffolding is a meta-package for applications and services and Habitat provides scaffoldings for several languages. They provide a default configuration and behavior experience that gets application developers up and running quickly with Habitat.

    And in the case of the Ruby scaffolding, if you set up PostgreSQL as your database (as we did in the myrailsapp sample code), the Ruby scaffolding will create configuration and credential information to connect to that database. For more information on scaffoldings, see the scaffolding [concepts topic](/docs/concepts-scaffolding).

2. Now that you have created a basic plan, change directories into your newly-created `habitat` sub-directory and open plan.sh in your text editor.

    Your `plan.sh` should now look like this:

    ```bash
    pkg_name=myrailsapp
    pkg_origin=<originname>
    pkg_scaffolding="core/scaffolding-ruby"
    ```
    > **Note** The origin name that you used when you ran `hab setup` during [Download and Install](/tutorials/download/) is used to populate the `pkg_origin` variable in your plan.sh file.

3. The `pkg_origin` and `pkg_name` settings partially form the package identifier information. In order to build your package, you also need to have a version number associated with it. To do so, add the following line to your plan.sh:

    ```bash
    pkg_version="0.1.0"
    ```
4. As part of the health_check hook that you will create in the next step, you also need to add a runtime dependency on `core/curl`.

    ```bash
    pkg_deps=( core/curl )
    ```

## Add in Service Binding Support

Service binding is accomplished when one service provides a setting, or collection of settings, that other services can consume and use at runtime. The `core/postgresql`
package exposes a `port` configuration value that can be used by consuming services, such as the Rails application you are building in this tutorial. The Ruby scaffolding
will create a default connection string to the PostgreSQL service and will use this value when making that connection.

To enable the `myrailsapp` to use the exported `port` value from `core/postgresql`, add the following line to your plan.sh file:

```bash
pkg_binds=( [database]="port" )
```
Other settings are described in the [Plan syntax guide](/docs/reference/plan-syntax).

## Finished Plan

Your finished plan should look like the following:

    pkg_name=myrailsapp
    pkg_origin=<originname>
    pkg_scaffolding="core/scaffolding-ruby"
    pkg_version="0.1.0"
    pkg_deps=( core/curl )
    pkg_binds=( [database]="port" )

Now it is time to add custom health monitoring to your plan.
