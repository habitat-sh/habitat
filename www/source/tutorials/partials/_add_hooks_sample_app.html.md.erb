Habitat provides basic health monitoring for your running service; however, if you want to 
perform custom tests or other status checks, you can customize your plan to do that. This is 
done by using a `health_check` hook, which is a script that responds to a specific event during the lifecycle 
of a running service.

There are multiple hooks that you can define in your plan. For example, the `init` and `run` hooks are responsible 
for defining behavior during initialization and when the child service/application starts up. The Ruby scaffolding
creates the initialization for you to handle connecting to a backend database and the build script used by the studio
creates a generic run hook. However, to create the `health_check` hook, you have to perform the following operations:

1. Change directory to `hooks`.

<% if !is_windows %>
    ```console
    $ cd hooks
    ```
<% end %>

<% if is_windows %>

    ```powershell
    PS > cd hooks
    ```
<% end %>
2. Create a new file named `health_check`.

<% if !is_windows %>
    ```
    $ touch health_check
    ```
<% end %>

<% if is_windows %>
    ```powershell
    PS > New-Item -ItemType file health_check
    ```
<% end %>
3. Open `health_check` in your text editor.
4. Hooks use [shebangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) to decide which interpreter to use when running their scripts. 
In the case of the hook in our plan, we will use the system shell, so add the following to the `health_check` hook file:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/sh
    #

    # default return code is 0
    rc=0

    # This request will test whether our index page can be retrieved. 
    hab pkg exec core/curl curl -sS --head --fail --max-time 1 http://localhost:{{cfg.app.port}}/

    case $? in
        # Zero exit status means curl got back a 200 end everything is ok.
        0)
            rc=0 ;;
        # Anything else is critical.
        *)
            rc=2 ;;
    esac

    exit $rc
    ```

This hook performs a basic test to check whether the results of the curl command return a status code less than 400. 
If the curl command doesn't succeed, then this check will be denoted as "critical."

5. Save the `health_check` hook file.
