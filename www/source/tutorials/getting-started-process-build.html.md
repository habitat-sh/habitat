# Run your service
The Habitat depot can contain multiple versions and releases of a given artifact. When you start a Habitat service, and depending on whether or not you specify a particular version number, Habitat will either pull the latest version, or the latest release for that particular version of the artifact.

A supervisor manages any client app or service process within a Habitat service, so when a Habitat service starts up, the Supervisor executes a command on the client software through a run script that was either generated by Habitat when the artifact was built (through the `pkg_binaries_run` setting), or through a run hook like in the case of mytutorialapp.

Services can currently be run in two different ways: You can either use the supervisor (`hab-sup`) directly, or you can use a Docker container that calls the supervisor. Using the `hab-sup` directly allows you to rapidly install and test your services before uploading any artifacts into a depot; however, using a Docker container does not require you to have the Habitat binaries built and installed on your host machine. Exporting your artifact into a Docker container also allows you to create a portable Habitat service that can be run anywhere Docker containers can run.

For information on how to natively run Habitat services, see [Run Services](/docs/run-services).

To show the portability of Habitat, you will export and run a Habitat service from within a Docker container through the following steps:

1. If you are not in the studio environment, enter it from the dev shell container with the `hab-studio enter` command.
2. Change directory to the `/src/plans` directory.

        [15][default:/src:0]# cd plans

3. Build your version of the mytutorialapp artifact.

        [16][default:/src/plans:0]# build mytutorialapp

4. Run `hab install core/hab-pkg-dockerize` to unpack and install the artifact that creates docker images for other Habitat artifacts.

        [17][default:/src/plans:0]# hab install core/hab-pkg-dockerize

5. Change directory and run `hab pkg exec core/hab-pkg-dockerize hab-pkg-dockerize origin/packagename` with the origin and name of your artifact. These values are referenced in the pkg_origin and pkg_name settings of your plan, respectively.

        [18][default:/src/plans:0]$cd /src
        [18][default:/src:0]$hab pkg exec core/hab-pkg-dockerize hab-pkg-dockerize myorigin/mytutorialapp

    Habitat will proceed to unpack and install all necessary Habitat artifacts, the Habitat command-line interface (CLI) tools and binaries, the mytutorialapp artifact, and all of its dependencies. Then it will create an image using the Docker scratch image as the base image and build up the rest of the image from there.

    Once that process has completed, you can run your Docker image inside a container from any terminal window that has access to the Docker CLI, such as the dev shell container or your host machine.

      > Note: We have to publish the Docker container port number to allow that container to be accessed by the host machine. Also, you may need to connect your shell to the host machine using `eval "$(docker-machine env default)"` if you are running Mac OS X.

        $ docker run -it -p 8080:8080 myorigin/mytutorialapp

        mytutorialapp(O): Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080

4. Because we are running this service in a Docker container, you need the IP address of the VM that is running it to access the message of the day. If your host machine is running Mac OS X, type the following command in your terminal window to bring up the site.

        open "http://$(docker-machine ip default):8080/"

    If you're running on Linux, you can simply open a browser and go to http://localhost:8080.

    Here's an example of what you should see in your browser:

5. You can also re-run your docker container and update the message value when your Habitat service starts up. To do this, you must pass in a Docker environment variable with the following format: `HAB_PACKAGENAME='keyname=newvalue'`.

    > Note: The package name in the environment variable must be uppercase and any dashes must be replaced with underscores.

    Here is how you change the message for _mytutorialapp_:


        $ docker run -e HAB_MYTUTORIALAPP='message="Habitat rocks!"' -p 8080:8080 -it myorigin/mytutorialapp
        hab-sup(MN): Starting myorigin/mytutorialapp

        mytutorialapp(O):
        mytutorialapp(O): Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080

Congratulations, you have successfully built a package from scratch, ran it locally, and tested out some of the configuration capabilities!
