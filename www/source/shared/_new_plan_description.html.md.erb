Let's walk through these settings:

- The `pkg_origin`, `pkg_name`, and `pkg_version` settings form the package identifier information.
- The `pkg_maintainer` and `pkg_license` settings provide contact and license type information.
- The `pkg_source` setting refers to the archive where the source code for your application is located and the `pkg_shasum` is the checksum used to validate that the source file is correct.
- The `pkg_deps` and `pkg_build_deps` correspond to the runtime and build-time package dependencies, respectively.
- The `pkg_bin_dirs`, `pkg_include_dirs`, and `pkg_lib_dirs` define the directories where any binaries, libraries, or other include files will be located once the package is built.
