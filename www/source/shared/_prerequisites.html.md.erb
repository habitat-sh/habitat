## Prerequisites
 
Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have completed the following:

* All steps in the [Download and Install]() section on your workstation. You will not be able 
to complete the tutorial without downloading the `hab` CLI, setting up your local environment, and running the `hab setup` command.

* Install [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) on your workstation. 

> **Note** The minimum Docker version required for Habitat is greater than or equal to the version specified in the latest stable 
`core/docker` package, which currently is 1.31.1.

Also, we will be using Docker Compose in the tutorial. If you already have Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows installed and running, 
then you are setup to use Docker Compose. For Linux users, please follow the instructions to install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

If you are running an older Windows 10 version such as 1511, ANSI escape sequences are not supported. This means the color output and other formatting used
by the `hab` CLI will not render properly in your PowerShell window. You can use console emulators like [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) to run PowerShell with 
ANSI color support.
