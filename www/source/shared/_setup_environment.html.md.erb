The `hab` command-line interface (CLI) tool downloads the studio and other tools when it needs them, so setup for Habitat is centered on where you want the `hab` CLI installed and getting it integrated into your shell.

1.  Open a terminal window. Change directory to the directory where you want to place the `hab` CLI. The following example creates a directory called `bin` and places it at the root of the home directory.

        mkdir -p ~/bin && cd ~/bin

2.  Copy the `hab` CLI to that directory.

3. If your host machine is running Mac OS X, add the location for the `hab` CLI to your `PATH` environment variable.

       export PATH=$PATH:~/bin

    To keep from typing this in for every terminal window you use, add the above statement to your shell profile.

4. Open a terminal window and run `hab`. If you're running on Mac OS X, make sure your docker-machine is running and your shell is connected to the host machine.

       docker-machine start
       eval "$(docker-machine env machinename)"
