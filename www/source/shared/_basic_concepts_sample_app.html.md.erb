# Concepts

Here are the concepts that you will learn about in this tutorial:

-   **Package**: A portable, cryptographically-signed tarball that contains an application, runtime, dependencies, and any configuration data.
-   **Scaffolding**: Meta-packages that provide implementations of common application packages such as Ruby webapps, Node.js, Go, and others. 
Used to quickly create packages with default use cases.
-   **Supervisor**: A process manager that supports the application or service in the package. It handles any real-time configuration updates 
to the application, participates in communication with other supervisors running in deployed Habitat services, and provides health monitoring 
and other status messages about the service, which can be queried by another application.
-   **Habitat service**: A running supervisor with the application or service of the package running inside it.
-   **Plan**: Shell scripts that define what your package contains, how it is built, and how it can be configured.
-   **Depot**: A repository that contains application and dependency packages. You can connect to the public Habitat depot as well as create a local depot.
