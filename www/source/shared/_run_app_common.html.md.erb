Services can currently be run in two ways: natively on a modern, 64-bit Linux distribution with the kernel version 
greater than 2.6.32, or in a supported external runtime format. Running services natively allows you to rapidly install 
and test your services on bare metal machines or VMs, but exporting your package into a different runtime 
format provides flexibility in where your packages run.
