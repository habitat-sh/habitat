h1 Why Habitat?

p Habitat exists to solve the problem of how we build, deploy, and manage
  applications. As Marc Andreessen declared in 2011, <a
  href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">"software
  is eating the world"</a>. In every sector, in every industry, from small startups
  to the largest of enterprises, we see software at the center of how we build and run
  our companies, and how we interact with our customers. This shift forces us all to
  become fast, efficient, software-driven organizations&mdash;or lose out to a competitor
  who is.

p This challenge is not simply technical. It is also organizational and it is cultural.
  We have to change the way we work together, hand-in-hand with changing the
  systems that enable us all. We need to build solutions that help create the culture that
  enables us.


h2. What have we done so far?

p As an industry, we have designed our solutions to this problem either from
  the perspective of the Enterprise, or the perspective of the Big Web
  (Facebook, Google, Netflix, Twitter, etc.).

p When we start from the
  Enterprise, we tend to build solutions that are too narrowly focused. Our
  software becomes an example of
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Conway's Law</a> in action.
  The deep silo-ing of responsibility present in most enterpries drives us to design
  software specifically for one silo or another: we build security software, or we
  build application deployment software, or we build configuration management software.
  If we endeavour to escape this trap by designing solutions that cut across the silos,
  we fall prey to another issue: we're forced to integrate into every silo's existing
  software toolchain. The result tends to be systems that are deeply complex, and
  very difficult to understand and operate&mdash;or worse, that are only as good as
  their worst point of integration. It is difficult to escape the complexity of
  the matrix between different eras of technology and deep silo-ing.

p When we look to the Big Web for inspiration, things look better. While each company
  is different, they all share in the ability to deliver software efficently, safely,
  at speed. They accomplish this feat by establishing a simpler, more standardized
  infrastructure layer than their enterprise compatriots. On top of this, they build
  a runtime that supports the applications they build, making it easy for their software
  development teams to write new software, and streamlining their operations. It feels
  intuitively right that we should look here, at least directionally, for the solution
  to our problem.

p Yet two facts quickly arise that make this direction difficult
  as a general-purpose solution. First, these companies all share one fundamental
  truth: they controlled the destiny of their applications from day one. Unlike the
  Enterprise, the Big Web wrote their software from scratch. This reality leads
  naturally to the second truth: the platform they built <em>is</em> the business. If we
  follow this path, we will have to re-write most of the software in the world to
  target a specific runtime platform&mdash;one which, as of today, doesn't exist,
  and has no analog in the big web, because each platform is different.

h2. Taking the application's perspective

p Habitat started by asking this question: if our goal is to quickly and safely
  build, deploy, and manage applications, what would happen if we took the application's
  perspective on the problem? Rather than starting from the Enterprise point-of-view,
  or from the platform-centric view of the Big Web, what if we simply focused in on
  what it means to be easy to build, easy to manage, and easy to deploy?

p We call the answer we found <strong>Application Automation</strong>. Our great discovery was simply
  that the automation must travel with the application, rather than be provided by the
  platform. Everything the application needs, from build dependencies, run-time
  dependencies, configuration, dynamic topologies, deployment strategies,
  secrets management, security auditing, and so on belongs with the application, because
  we're doing it for the application. Runtime and infrastructure layers exist to
  support the application, but the efficient building, deployment, and management
  of the application are decoupled from those layers.

h2. Existing and Cloud Native Software: One management layer

p The result is that we can take an application, wrap it in a layer of application
  automation, and the resulting package can be deployed on the infrastructure
  or runtime that suits it best. If your application has hard requirements on physical
  infrastructure (SAN settings, network topologies, GPUs, etc.), you can deploy it
  there, and manage it the same way you manage the software that deploys on top of
  a PaaS, or in a container.

img[src="/images/why-habitat/gossip-ring.png" style="margin: 2em 2em 2em auto;" class="float-left small-12 medium-6"]

h2. Packaging and Supervision

p Habitat accomplishes this by providing two main components: a robust,
  safe, simple, and secure software packaging system; and a supervisor
  which manages the lifecycle of the services declared in these packages. The packaging
  layer creates immutable, atomic packages, which contain both the software and
  all of its configuration options.

p The supervisor component is where the run-time magic happens. Each supervisor
  can be joined with many others in a "ring", with the service it manages formed
  together into service groups. These supervisors can then handle ensuring the
  application has the correct configuration, has the right secrets, is in the
  correct topology, coordinates dynamic software upgrades, and more.

h2. Avoiding the Production Cliff

img[src="/images/why-habitat/difficulty-curve-07.png" style="margin-bottom: 2em; padding: 2em;" class="float-right small-12 medium-7"]

p This architecture allows us to avoid the production cliff problem: the closer you get
  to production, the more difficult it is. Rather than force the deployment of
  more and more infrastructure and management software as you approach
  production, operations teams can simply pass more options to the supervisor:
  declaring the correct topology, update strategy, and configuration. Deploying
  the application <em>is</em> deploying the automation&mdash;all of it.

h2. Try Habitat!

p We're proud of Habitat. We think it makes the software you already have better.
  We also think it makes the runtime and infrastructure platforms you're moving to better.
  Habitat is technology
  that simplifies the complexity of how we build, deploy, and manage our applications;
  empowers the teams that need to collaborate in order to deliver the future; and
  accelerates the speed with which we can get a better experience out to our users.
