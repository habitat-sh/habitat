To assist in creating new packages, or modifying existing ones, the Supervisor
has an option to allow you to use the configuration directly from a specific
directory, rather than the one it includes in the compiled artifact. This can
significantly shorten the cycle time when working on configuration and hooks.

Start the Supervisor from within the studio and pass the name of the directory with your plan inside it:

```shell
$ hab sup run origin/package --config-from /src
```

This would take the configuration and hooks from `/src`, rather than from the
package you have previously built. When the configuration is as you want it,
do a final rebuild of the package.
