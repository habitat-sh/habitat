# Template Data

The following settings can be used during a Habitat service's lifecycle. This means that you can use these settings in any of the plan hooks, such as `init`, or `run`, and also in any templatized configuration file for your application or service.

These configuration settings are referenced using the [Handlebars.js](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/) version of [Mustache-style](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) tags.

## sys

| path | string | The location where the package is installed locally, e.g., `/hab/pkgs/core/redis/3.2.4/20170514150022`. Note that this is _not_ a `PATH` environment variable; for that, please see the `env` key above. |

| svc_group | string | The value of `pkg_svc_group` specified in a plan. |

## cfg

These are settings defined in your templatized configuration file. The values for those settings are pulled from the `default.toml` file included in your package.

## Reference Objects

Some of the template expressions referenced above return objects of a specific shape; for example, the `svc.me` and `svc.first` expressions return "service member" objects, and the `pkg` property of a service member returns a "package identifier" object. These are defined below.

### package_identifier

| release | string | The release of the Habitat package |

### svc_member
