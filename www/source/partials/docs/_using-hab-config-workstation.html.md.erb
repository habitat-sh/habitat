Once Habitat has been installed, the <code>hab</code> CLI makes it easy to get your workstation configured by guiding through the setup process. To set up your workstation, run <code>hab setup</code> and follow the instructions.

Setup asks you to create a new origin and a set of origin keys.

Optionally, you can also provide a Habitat personal access token to upload packages to the public depot and share them with the Habitat community. See the [access token documentation](/docs/using-builder/#builder-token) for details on generating and using your access token. You can also add a previously-generated control gateway secret that is used to authenticate commands sent to a remote Supervisor. See the [control gateway](/docs/internals#control-gateway) documentation for more information.

> For more information about using Habitat Builder, see the section on [Working with Builder](/docs/using-builder/).

During setup, you may elect to provide anonymous usage data of the <code>hab</code> CLI tool. This information is used by the Habitat team to improve the CLI experience.
For information on the types of data we gather and how we intend to use it, see [Analytics in Habitat](/docs/about-analytics).

You can change your settings at any time by re-running the <code>hab setup</code> command.

That's it. You're all set up and ready to use Habitat to build and run packages!
