# <a name="multiple-plans-builder" id="multiple-plans-builder" data-magellan-target="multiple-plans-builder">Using Builder with Multiple Plans</a>

If you have a large GitHub repository with multiple components inside, you will most likely also have individual plans for those components. When using Builder to build your packages, the default behavior is for Builder to build all packages whenever any file is updated in that repository, regardless of what component it is. This is because Builder does not know which file is associated with which package.

To provide more fine-grained control over when component packages are built, you can programatically customize how and when Builder will build your plans by specifying build behavior in a `.bldr.toml` file at the root of the repository that you connect to Builder.

Using this file, Builder only builds packages when source files or directories are updated in paths specified in `.bldr.toml`. This allows you to configure the building, publishing, and post-processing phases of a plan build in Builder.

To enable this functionality, do the following:

1. Create a `.bldr.toml` in the root of your repository.

2. Open it and add an entry for each component package that you want to build.

    The `.bldr.toml` file is in TOML format, so create a TOML table specifying the `$pkg_name` value for that plan and then add a `plan_path` field specifying the path to your `plan.sh` file (you do not need to include plan.sh explicitly in the path). If all the files related to the plan are under the plan path, then you are done. Otherwise, you will need an addition 'path' field specifying Unix-style path globs to files that are associated with the plan you specified in the 'plan_path'. File or directory changes made in these path locations determine which packages will be rebuilt. Basically, when a file is committed, Builder will check to see whether it falls underneath the `plan_path` hierarchy, or matches one of the globs in the `path` field if it was specified - if the answer is yes, then Builder will issue a build for that commit.

    For example, in the Habitat repository itself, this TOML states that the `hab-launcher`, `hab-studio`, and `hab-sup` packages will be rebuilt if there are any changes in any of the specified `components` sub-directories. Note that `hab-studio` does not need to specify a `path` because all of it's files are within the `plan_path` hierarchy, but that is not the case for the other projects.

    ```toml
    # .bldr.toml
    [hab-launcher]
    plan_path = "components/launcher/habitat"
    paths = [
      "components/launcher/*",
      "components/launcher-protocol/*",
      "support/ci/builder-base-plan.sh",
    ]

    [hab-studio]
    plan_path = "components/studio"

    [hab-sup]
    plan_path = "components/sup"
    paths = [
      "components/sup/*",
      "components/eventsrv-client/*",
      "components/launcher-client/*",
      "components/butterfly/*",
      "components/core/*",
      "components/builder-depot-client/*",
    ]
    ```

## Special case where `.bldr.toml` does not exist

In the default case, where the `.bldr.toml` does not exist, there is one other condition that can impact builds. If the `plan.sh` file is not at the root (e.g., it is located in a `habitat` folder), then Builder infers that the plan files are all underneath the `habitat` folder, and will not kick off a build if files are committed that are outside of that folder.

In order to have automated builds kick off in this case, either move your `plan.sh` file to the root of the repo, or add a `.bldr.toml` file to specify the paths more explicitly.
