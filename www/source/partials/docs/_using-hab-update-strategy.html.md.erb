The Habitat Supervisor can be configured to leverage an optional _update strategy_, which describes how the Supervisor and its peers within a service group should respond when a new version of a package is available.

To use an update strategy, the Supervisor is configured to subscribe to Habitat Builder, and more specifically, a channel for new versions.

## Configuring an Update Strategy

Habitat supports three update strategies: `none`, `rolling`, and `at-once`.

To start a Supervisor with the auto-update strategy, pass the `--strategy` argument to a Supervisor start command, and optionally specify the depot URL:

```shell
$ hab sup run yourorigin/yourapp --strategy rolling --url https://bldr.habitat.sh
```

### None Strategy

This strategy means your package will not automatically be updated when a newer version is available. By default, Supervisors start with their update strategy set to `none` unless explicitly set to one of the other two update strategies.

### Rolling Strategy

This strategy requires Supervisors to update to a newer version of their package one at a time in their service group. An update leader is elected which all Supervisors within a service group will update around. All update followers will first ensure they are running the same version of a service that their leader is running, and then, the leader will poll Builder for a newer version of the service's package.

Once the update leader finds a new version it will update and wait until all other alive members in the service group have also been updated before once again attempting to find a newer version of software to update to. Updates will happen more or less one at a time until completion with the exception of a new node being introduced into the service group during the middle of an update.

If your service group is also running with the `--topology leader` flag, the leader of that election will never become the update leader, so all followers within a leader topology will update first.

It's important to note that because we must perform a leader election to determine an update leader, *you must have at least 3 Supervisors running a service group to take advantage of the rolling update strategy*.

### At-Once Strategy

This strategy does no peer coordination with other Supervisors in the service group; it merely updates the underlying Habitat package whenever it detects that a new version has either been published to a depot or installed to the local habitat `pkg` cache. No coordination between Supervisors is done, each Supervisor will poll Builder on their own.
