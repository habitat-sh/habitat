# <a name="glossary-hab">Hab</a>
The primary user facing API in the habitat framework is the `hab` CLI. Almost anything you could want to do within the ecosystem of habitat can be managed via the `hab` CLI. It includes subcommands for executing package builds, loading services into the process supervisor, uploading packages to builder, and entering the studio. For more information on all of the functionality of `hab` feel free to peruse our [CLI command documentation](/docs/habitat-cli).
