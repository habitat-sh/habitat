# <a name="overview" id="overview" data-magellan-target="overview">Using Habitat</a>

Habitat centers application configuration, management, and behavior around the application itself, not the infrastructure or operating system it runs on. This allows Habitat to be deployed and run on a wide array of clouds, datacenters, schedulers, and platforms.

This section of the Habitat documentation is dedicated to the operational aspects of the framework and how to use the various tools Habitat brings to the table. If you don't yet have an understanding of the way Habitat handles automation of your application we would highly recommend visiting [our tutorials](/tutorials/get-started) to get some quick hands on experience with the framework before diving into the docs.
