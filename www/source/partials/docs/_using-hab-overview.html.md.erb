# <a name="overview">Overview</a>

Habitat centers application configuration, management, and behavior around the application itself, not the infrastructure that the app runs on. This allows Habitat to be deployed and run on various infrastructure environments, such as bare metal, VM, containers, and PaaS.

The Habitat documentation is broken out into the following sections:

**Getting Started**

- [Download and install Habitat](/tutorials/download): Download the `hab` command-line interface tool (CLI) for Mac, Linux, and Windows to get started using Habitat.
- [Tutorials](/tutorials): Location for our getting started and advanced tutorials. You should start here if you are new to Habitat.

**Using Habitat**

- [Build packages](/docs/create-packages-overview): Learn how to create a plan, what all of the plan settings are, how to configure a package, and how to build packages.
- [Run packages](/docs/run-packages-overview): Learn how to run a package natively as well as through an external runtime format, such as a Docker or rkt container.
- [Share packages](/docs/share-packages-overview): Describes how to upload, share, and run Habitat packages from the public depot.
- [Continuous deployment](/docs/continuous-deployment-overview): Explains how Habitat supports continuous deployment and the implementation details of deploying Habitat packages through Chef Automate.
- [Container orchestration](/docs/container-orchestration): Describes how to use Habitat with container orchestration technologies such as EC2 Container Service, Mesos, and Kubernetes.
- [Habitat internals](/docs/internals-overview): Provides deeper explanations on topics such as how the Supervisor works, how leader election happens, etc.

**Reference**

- [Glossary](/docs/glossary): Describes the major components of Habitat and how they work.
- [CLI reference](/docs/habitat-cli): Usage and basic help documentation for all `hab` CLI commands and subcommands.

- [Environment variables](/docs/reference/environment-vars): All environment variables that you can modify when using the `hab` CLI.
- [Package contents](/docs/reference/package-contents): Dependency, build, and configuration files that are included in a Habitat package.

**Contribute**
