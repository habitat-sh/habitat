# <a name="environment-variables" id="environment-variables" data-magellan-target="environment-variables">Environment Variables</a>

This is a list of all environment variables that can be used to modify the operation of the Habitat Studio and Supervisor. For information on defining environment variables with the scaffoldings, check out the "Define Environment Variables" section of <a href="/tutorials/build-your-own/">Build your web application with Habitat</a>!

| Variable | Context | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `HAB_AUTH_TOKEN` | build system | no default | Authorization token used to perform privileged operations against the depot, e.g. uploading packages or keys.
| `HAB_BINLINK_DIR` | build system | `/hab/bin` | Allows you to change the target directory for the symlink created when you run `hab pkg binlink`. The default value is already included in the `$PATH` variable inside the Studio. |
| `HAB_CACHE_KEY_PATH` | build system, Supervisor | `/hab/cache/keys` if running as root; `$HOME/.hab/cache/keys` if running as non-root | Cache directory for origin signing keys |
| `HAB_CTL_SECRET` | Supervisor | Generates a new key, if one is not present | Authentication key that is used to pass commands to a remote Supervisor via the [control gateway](/docs/internals#control-gateway). |
| `HAB_BLDR_CHANNEL` | build system, Supervisor | `stable` | Set the Habitat Builder channel you are subscribing to, to a specific channel. Defaults to `stable`.
| `HAB_BLDR_URL` | build system, Supervisor | `https://bldr.habitat.sh` | Sets an alternate default endpoint for communicating with Builder. Used by the Habitat build system and the Supervisor |
| `HAB_DOCKER_OPTS` | build system | no default | When running a Studio on a platform that uses Docker (MacOS), additional command line options to pass to the `docker` command. |
| `HAB_INTERNAL_BLDR_CHANNEL` | build system, Supervisor, exporters | `stable` | Channel from which Habitat-specific packages (e.g., `core/hab-sup`, `core/hab-launcher`, etc.) are downloaded on-demand when first called. Generally of use only for those developing Habitat. Only applies to Habitat-specific packages, and nothing else. |
| `HAB_NOCOLORING` | build system | no default | If set to the lowercase string `"true"` this environment variable will unconditionally disable text coloring where possible |
| `HAB_NONINTERACTIVE` | build system | no default | If set to the lowercase string `"true"` this environment variable will unconditionally disable interactive progress bars (i.e. "spinners") where possible |
| `HAB_ORG` | Supervisor | no default | Organization to use when running with [service group encryption](/docs/using-habitat#using-encryption)
| `HAB_ORIGIN` | build system | no default | Origin used to build packages. The signing key for this origin is passed to the build system. |
| `HAB_ORIGIN_KEYS` | build system | no default | Comma-separated list of origin keys to automatically share with the build system |
| `HAB_RING` | Supervisor | no default | The ring used by the Supervisor when running with [wire encryption](/docs/using-habitat#using-encryption) |
| `HAB_RING_KEY` | Supervisor | no default | The name of the ring key when running with [wire encryption](/docs/using-habitat#using-encryption) |
| `HAB_STUDIO_SECRET_<VARIABLE>` | build system | no default | Prefix to allow environment variables into the Studio. The prefix will be removed and your variable will be passed into the Studio at build time. |
| `HAB_STUDIOS_HOME` | build system | `/hab/studios` | Directory in which to create build Studios |
| `HAB_STUDIO_BACKLINE_PKG` | build system | `core/hab-backline/{{studio_version}}` | Overrides the default package identifier for the "backline" package which installs the Studio basline package set. |
| `HAB_STUDIO_ROOT` | build system | no default | Root of the current Studio under `$HAB_STUDIOS_HOME`. Infrequently overridden. |
| `HAB_STUDIO_NOSTUDIORC` | build system | no default | When set to a non-empty value, a `.studiorc` will not be sourced when entering an interactive Studio via `hab studio enter`. |
| `HAB_STUDIO_SUP` | build system | no default | Used to customize the arguments passed to an automatically launched Supervisor, or to disable the automatic launching by setting it to `false`, `no`, or `0`. |
| `HAB_UPDATE_STRATEGY_FREQUENCY_MS` | Supervisor | 60000 | Frequency of milliseconds to check for updates when running with an [update strategy](/docs/using-habitat#using-updates) |
| `HAB_USER` | Supervisor | no default | User key to use when running with [service group encryption](/docs/using-habitat#using-encryption) |
| `http_proxy` | build system, Supervisor | no default | A URL for a local HTTP proxy server optionally supporting basic authentication |
| `https_proxy` | build system, Supervisor | no default | A URL for a local HTTPS proxy server optionally supporting basic authentication |
| `NO_INSTALL_DEPS` | build system | no default | Set this variable to prevent dependencies install during build |
| `no_proxy` | build system, Supervisor | no default | A comma-separated list of domain exclusions for the `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` environment variables |
| `SSL_CERT_FILE` | system | no default | Standard OpenSSL environment variable to override the system certificate file. This is particularly important for the secure HTTPS connection with a Builder instance. Can be used to help you navigate corporate firewalls. |

# Customizing Studio

When you enter a Studio, Habitat will attempt to locate `/src/.studiorc` and
source it.  Think `~/.bashrc`. This file can be used to export any
environment variables like the ones you see above as well as any other shell
customizations to help you develop your plans from within the Studio.

To use this feature, place a `.studiorc` in the current working directory
where you will run `hab studio enter`.

Note that a `.studiorc` will only be source when using `hab studio enter`--it will not be sourced when calling `hab studio run` or `hab studio build` (also `hab pkg build`).
