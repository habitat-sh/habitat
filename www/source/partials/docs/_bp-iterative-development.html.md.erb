To assist in creating new packages, or modifying existing ones, the Supervisor
has an option to allow you to use the configuration directly from a specific
directory, rather than the one it includes in the compiled artifact. This can
significantly shorten the cycle time when working on configuration and application lifecycle hooks.

Build the plan as you normally would. When you start the Supervisor, pass the name of the directory with your plan inside it:

```shell
$ hab sup run core/redis --config-from /src
```

The Supervisor will now take its configuration and hooks from /src, rather than from the
package you previously built. When the configuration is as you want it,
do a final rebuild of the package.
