Packages need to be signed with a secret origin key at buildtime. Generate an origin key pair manually by running the following command on your host machine:

```shell
$ hab origin key generate <ORIGIN>
```

The `hab-origin` subcommand will place originname-_timestamp_.sig.key and originname-_timestamp_.pub files (the origin key pair) in the `$HOME/.hab/cache/keys` directory. If you're creating origin keys in the Studio container or you are running as root on a Linux machine, your keys will be stored in `/hab/cache/keys`.

Because the secret key is used to sign your package, it should not be shared freely; however, if anyone wants to download and use your package, then they must have your public key (.pub) installed in their local `$HOME/.hab/cache/keys` or `/hab/cache/keys` directory. Public keys will be downloaded from Chef Habitat Builder by the Supervisor, if needed.

### Passing origin keys into the Studio

When you enter the Studio environment, your origin keys are not automatically shared into it. This is to keep the Studio environment as clean as possible. However, because you need to reference a secret origin key to sign your package, you can do this in three ways:

* Set `HAB_ORIGIN` to the name of the secret origin key you intend to use before entering the Studio like `export HAB_ORIGIN=originname`.
* Set `HAB_ORIGIN_KEYS` to one or more key names, separated by commas like `export HAB_ORIGIN_KEYS=originname-internal,originname-test,originname`.
* Use the `-k` flag (short for “keys”) which accepts one or more key names separated by commas with `hab studio -k originname-internal,originname-test enter`.

The first way overrides the `HAB_ORIGIN` environment variable to import public and secret keys into the Studio environment and override any `pkg_origin` values in the packages that you build. This is useful if you want to not only build your package, but also you can use this to build your own versions of other packages, such as `originname/node` or `originname/glibc`.

The second and third way import multiple secret keys that must match the origin names for the plans you intend to build.

After you create or receive your secret origin key, you can start up the Studio and build your package.

## Interactive Build

An interactive build is one in which you enter a Chef Habitat Studio to perform the build. Doing this allows you to examine the build environment before, during, and after the build.

The directory where your plan is located is known as the plan context.

1. Change to the parent directory of the plan context.
2. Create and enter a new Chef Habitat Studio. If you have defined an origin and origin key during `hab cli setup` or by explicitly setting the `HAB_ORIGIN` and `HAB_ORIGIN_KEYS` environment variables, then type the following:

    ```shell
    $ hab studio enter
    ```

    The directory you were in is now mounted as `/src` inside the Studio. By default, a Supervisor runs in the background for iterative testing. You can see the streaming output by running <code>sup-log</code>. Type <code>Ctrl-C</code> to exit the streaming output and <code>sup-term</code> to terminate the background Supervisor. If you terminate the background Supervisor, then running <code>sup-run</code> will restart it along with every service that was previously loaded. You have to explicitly run <code>hab svc unload origin/package</code> to remove a package from the "loaded" list.

3. Enter the following command to create the package.

    ```studio
    $ build /src/planname
    ```

4. If the package builds successfully, it is placed into a `results` directory at the same level as your plan.

### Managing the type of Studio to enter (Docker/Linux/Windows)

Depending on the platform of your host and your Docker configuration, the behavior of `hab studio enter` may vary. Here is the default behavior listed by host platform:

* **Linux** - A local chrooted Linux Studio. You can force a Docker based studio by using the `-D`` flag.
* **Mac** - A Docker container based Linux Studio
* **Windows** - A Docker container based Studio where the platform depends on the mode your Docker service is running, which can be toggled between Linux Containers and Windows Containers. Make sure your Docker service is running in the correct mode for the kind of studio you wish to enter. You may also use the `-w` flag to enter a local, non-containerized Windows studio.

> Note: For more details related to Windows containers see [Running Chef Habitat Windows Containers](/docs/best-practices/#running-habitat-windows-containers).

### Building Dependent Plans in the Studio

Writing plans for multiple packages that are dependent on each other can prove cumbersome when using multiple studios, as you need update dependencies frequently. On the other hand, using a single studio allows you to quickly test your changes by using locally built packages. To do so, you should use a folder structure like this:

```shell
$ tree projects
projects/
├── project-a
└── project-b
```

This way, you can `hab studio enter` in `projects/`. If `project-b` depends on `project-a`, you can call `build project-a && build project-b` for example.

## Non-Interactive Build

A non-interactive build is one in which Chef Habitat creates a Studio for you, builds the package inside it, and then destroys the Studio, leaving the resulting `.hart` on your computer. Use a non-interactive build when you are sure the build will succeed, or in conjunction with a continuous integration system.

1. Change to the parent directory of the plan context.
2. Build the package in an unattended fashion, passing the name of the origin key to the command.

    ```shell
    $ hab pkg build yourpackage -k yourname
    ```

    > Similar to the `hab studio enter` command above, the type of studio where the build runs is determined by your host platform and `hab pkg build` takes the same `-w` and `-D` flags to adjust the studio environment if desired.

3. The resulting package is inside a directory called `results`, along with any build logs and a build report (`last_build.env`) that includes machine-parseable metadata about the build.

By default, the Studio is reset to a clean state after the package is built; however, *if you are using the Linux version of `hab`*, you can reuse a previous Studio when building your package by specifying the `-R` option when calling the `hab pkg build` subcommand.
