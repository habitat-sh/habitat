#
# Any argument given to this script will be interpreted as a builder
# package to install on the machine. All Supervisor-related packages
# are always installed, and depending on the role the machine will
# play, additional packages should also be installed.
#
# To set up a machine as a worker, for example, you would call the
# script with the argument "core/builder-worker" (You could even just
# pass "builder-worker"; both are recognized.)
#
# Multiple packages can be specified.
#
# Do *not* provide version or release information.
