      Until we sort through a suspected Supervisor bug, releases have
      the potential to cause instability in Builder. Please declare a
      maintenance window in Statuspage before proceeding any further.

  - block: ":habicat: Wait until Builder is stabilized"
    prompt: |
      Until we sort through a suspected Supervisor bug, it is possible
      that Builder can get destabilized once the Supervisor has been
      promoted to the stable channel. This should be less of an issue
      as our operations and software mature, but until then, it is
      nice to explicitly factor that into our release process.
