      Windows builds are currently generated in Appveyor. They will be
      in Buildkite soon, but until then, we need to wait until
      Appveyor has generated the necessary artifacts and uploaded them
      to Builder and Bintray. Please ensure those artifacts have been
      uploaded before continuing with the release.

  - block: ":thumbsup: Select Launcher Versions to Promote to Release Channel"
    prompt: |
      Which `core/hab-launcher` versions should be in the release
      channel? This is helpful for validating a release, since all
      required packages will be in the same channel.

      Provide the fully-qualified identifier (e.g.,
      `core/hab-launcher/7797/20180625172404`) for each platform.

      Providing no value means that the current stable releases will be
      used. This is OK, because promoting something already `stable`
      to `stable` is a no-op.
