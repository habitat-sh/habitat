  # The repetition of the additional volume mounts as well as the
  # extra --org option pains my soul, but it doesn't appear that the
  # docker-compose `extends` feature allows you to reach back to
  # previous "layers" to modify them and let those changes naturally
  # bubble up.

  # Even though we'll be loading the files to the bastion, it doesn't
  # actually need to be running with the same `org` as the others. It
  # also doesn't need access to the keys, because it doesn't decrypt
  # anything. As such, we don't need to override anything for it.
