# Given a fresh install of Habitat we should be able to install packages from builder
# Ensure that we don't have any ssl certificates cached that might influence our ability
# to connect.
# Note: since we're testing pre-release this won't be a "pure" fresh install, as we
# have to curlbash install stable first, in order to get the pre-release version.
