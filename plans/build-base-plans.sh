#
# ```sh

# ```
#
# # Synopsis
#
# Builds a set of foundational base Plans comprising a fully bootstrapped Bldr
# environment which can be used to build additional software. The build order
# is very similiar to the Linux From Scratch project, and not by accident.

# non-zero exit code.

# If the variable `$DEBUG` is set, then print the shell commands as we execute.

# ## Default variables

# The build command to execute. Defaults to `build`, but could be overridden if
# a full path to `hab-plan-build` is required.
: ${BUILD:=build}
# The root path of the Habitat file system. If the `$HAB_ROOT_PATH` environment
# variable is set, this value is overridden, otherwise it is set to its default
: ${HAB_ROOT_PATH:=/hab}
# Location containing installed packages.
HAB_PKG_PATH="$HAB_ROOT_PATH/pkgs"
# The default package origin which was used to in the base Plans
origin=chef


# ## Private/Internal helper functions

# **Internal** Handles exiting the program on signals. Takes either an argument
# with the status code, or uses the last command's status code.
#
# For example, the following would both exit with a status of 1:
#
# ```bash
# _on_exit 1
# ```
#
# Or:
#
# ```bash
# false
# _on_exit
# ```
_on_exit() {
  local exit_status=${1:-$?}
  local elapsed=$SECONDS
  elapsed=$(echo $elapsed | awk '{printf "%dm%ds", $1/60, $1%60}')
  printf -- "\n$(basename $0) run time: $elapsed\n\n"
  if [ $exit_status -ne 0 ]; then echo "Exiting on error"; fi
  exit $?
}
# Call the `on_exit()` function above on the following signals:
#
# * HUP (1)
# * INT (2)
# * QUIT (3)
# * TERM (15)
# * ERR - when a shell command raises an error. Useful for `set -e; set -E`.

# Executes a build on a Plan, assuming that it has not already been built by a
# previous execution of this program. A very simple, plaintext database is
# maintained to track every Plan that has successfully completed so that if a
# Plan in the middle fails, a developer need only fix the failing Plan, and
# re-run the program--not needed to start from sqaure one. The database is
# `tmp/build-base-plans.db` by default so deleting this file simply removes its
# build "memory".

# _build gcc
# _build coreutils EXTRA=vars FOR=command
# ```
