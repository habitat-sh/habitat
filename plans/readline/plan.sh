# words, given 6 patches, the version of this Readline package would be
# `MAJOR.MINOR.6`.

  # This patch is to make sure that `libncurses' is among the `NEEDED'

  # applications linking against Readline are forced to explicitly link against
  # libncurses as well; in addition, this trick doesn't work when using GNU
  # ld's `--as-needed'.
