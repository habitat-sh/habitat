# ======================== Elasticsearch Configuration =========================
#
# NOTE: Elasticsearch comes with reasonable defaults for most settings.
#       Before you set out to tweak and tune the configuration, make sure you
#       understand what are you trying to accomplish and the consequences.
#
# The primary way of configuring a node is via this file. This template lists
# the most important settings you may want to configure for a production cluster.
#
# Please see the documentation for further information on configuration options:
# <http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-configuration.html>
#
# ---------------------------------- Cluster -----------------------------------
#
[cluster]
  #
  # Use a descriptive name for your cluster:
  #
  name = "elasticsearch"

  [cluster.routing.allocation]
    #
    # How many concurrent shard recoveries are allowed to happen on a node.
    # Defaults to 2.
    #
    node_concurrent_recoveries = "2"
    #
    # While the recovery of replicas happens over the network, the recovery of
    # an unassigned primary after node restart uses data from the local disk.
    # These should be fast so more initial primary recoveries can happen in
    # parallel on the same node. Defaults to 4.
    #
    node_initial_primaries_recoveries = "4"
    #
    # Allows to perform a check to prevent allocation of multiple instances of
    # the same shard on a single host, based on host name and host address.
    # Defaults to false, meaning that no check is performed by default. This
    # setting only applies if multiple nodes are started on the same machine.
    #
    same_shard-host = "false"
    #
    # https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/allocation-awareness.html
    #
    awareness-attributes = ""
#
# ------------------------------------ Node ------------------------------------
#
[node]
  # Use a descriptive name for the node:
  #
  name = ""
  #
  # Add custom attributes to the node:
  #
  # node.rack: r1
  #
  rack_id = ""
  zone    = ""
  #
  # Disable starting multiple nodes on a single system:
  #
  max_local_storage_nodes = 1
  #
  # Configure node as master-only, master-eligible, data-only, or client
  # (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/modules-node.html#master-node)
  # Default is master-eligible (master and data are both "true")
  #
  master = "true"
  data   = "true"

#
# ----------------------------------- Paths ------------------------------------
#
[path]
  #
  # Path to directory where to store the data (separate multiple locations by comma):
  #
  data =    "/hab/svc/elasticsearch/data"
  #
  # Path to log files:
  #
  logs =    "/hab/svc/elasticsearch/logs"
  #
  # Path to plugins:
  #
  plugins = "/hab/svc/elasticsearch/var"
  #
  # Path to scripts directory
  #
  scripts = "/hab/svc/elasticsearch/config/scripts"

#
# ----------------------------------- Indices ----------------------------------
#
[indices]

    max_bytes_per_sec  =            "20mb"

  [indices.fielddata]
    #
    # The max size of the field data cache, eg 30% of node heap space, or an absolute
    # value, eg 12GB. Defaults to unbounded.
    #
    cache-size =                   ""

  [indices.breaker]
    #
    # Starting limit for overall parent breaker, defaults to 70% of JVM heap.
    #
    total-limit =                    "70%"
    #
    # Limit for fielddata breaker, defaults to 60% of JVM heap.
    #
    fielddata-limit =                "60%"
    #
    # A constant that all field data estimations are multiplied with to determine a
    # final estimation. Defaults to 1.03
    #
    fielddata-overhead =             "1.03"

    # Limit for request breaker, defaults to 40% of JVM heap.

#
# ----------------------------------- Memory -----------------------------------
#
[bootstrap]
  # Lock the memory on startup:
  #
  mlockall = "true"
  #
  # Make sure that the heap size is set to about half the memory available
  # on the system and that the owner of the process is allowed to use this
  # limit.
  #
  # Elasticsearch performs poorly when the system is swapping the memory.
  #

#
# ---------------------------------- Network -----------------------------------
#
[network]
  #
  # Set the bind address to a specific IP (IPv4 or IPv6):
  #
  host =  "_site_"

  # Set a custom port for HTTP:
  #

#
# --------------------------------- Discovery ----------------------------------
#

  # The default list of hosts is ["127.0.0.1", "[::1]"]
  #
  ping_multicast_enabled = "false"

  # Prevent the "split brain" by configuring the majority of nodes (total number of nodes / 2 + 1):
  #
  minimum_master_nodes = 1
  #
  # For more information, see the documentation at:
  # <http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-discovery.html>
  #

#
# ---------------------------------- Gateway -----------------------------------
#
[gateway]
  #
  # Block initial recovery after a full cluster restart until N nodes are started:
  #
  recover_after_nodes   = ""
  #
  # The number of (data or master) nodes that are expected to be in the cluster.
  # Recovery of local shards will start as soon as the expected number of nodes
  # have joined the cluster. Defaults to 0
  #
  expected_nodes        = "0"
  #
  # The number of master nodes that are expected to be in the cluster. Recovery
  # of local shards will start as soon as the expected number of master nodes
  # have joined the cluster. Defaults to 0
  #
  expected_master_nodes = "0"
  #
  # The number of data nodes that are expected to be in the cluster. Recovery of
  # local shards will start as soon as the expected number of data nodes have
  # joined the cluster. Defaults to 0
  #
  expected_data_nodes   = "0"
  #
  # If the expected number of nodes is not achieved, the recovery process waits
  # for the configured amount of time before trying to recover regardless.
  # Defaults to 5m if one of the expected_nodes settings is configured.
