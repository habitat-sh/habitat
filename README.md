Want to try Habitat? [Get started here](https://www.habitat.sh/tutorials/get-started/demo/).

Habitat is an application automation framework that allows you to build applications that have automation built-in. This provides modern applications that:

* Provide repeatable builds
* Run from single, immutable assets
* Allow for runtime configuration for multiple deployment scenarios
* Are agnostic to operating environment (works the same on bare metal, virtualization, containers, PaaS)
* Provide idempotent behavior (the same inputs to the same asset provide the same outcome)
* Provide convergent behavior (each service makes progress towards the correct behavior in the face of failure)
* Expose promises to those who rely on it
* Provide a low barrier to entry
* Are language agnostic
