[Habitat](http://habitat.sh) is open source software that creates platform-independent build artifacts and provides built-in deployment and management capabilities.

The goal of Habitat is to allow you to automate your application behavior when you create your application, and then bundle your application with the automation it needs to behave with the correct run time behavior, update strategies, failure handling strategies, and scaling behavior, wherever you choose to deploy it.

See a quick demo of how to build, deploy and manage an application with Habitat:


**Project State**: [Active](https://github.com/chef/chef-oss-practices/blob/master/repo-management/repo-states.md#active)

**Issues Response Time Max**: 5 business days

**Pull Request Response Time Max**: 5 business days
