[Habitat](http://habitat.sh) is open source software that creates platform-independent build artifacts and provides built-in deployment and management capabilities.

The goal of Habitat is to allow you to automate your application behavior when you create your application, and then bundle your application with the automation it needs to behave with the correct run time behavior, update strategies, failure handling strategies, and scaling behavior, wherever you choose to deploy it.

See a quick demo of how to build, deploy and manage an application with Habitat:

## Hands-on Demos
Choose any topic to begin learning how Habitat can help your team build, deploy, and manage all of your applications - both new and legacy - in a cloud-native way:
* [Package a sample application (15 mins)](https://www.habitat.sh/demo/packaging-system/steps/1/)
* [Set up automated deployments (20 mins)](https://www.habitat.sh/demo/build-system/steps/1/)
* [Auto-update a running application (15 mins)](https://www.habitat.sh/demo/process-supervisor/steps/1/)

*View all demos and tutorials in [Learn](https://www.habitat.sh/learn/)*


## Install

You can download Habitat from the [Habitat downloads page](https://www.habitat.sh/docs/install-habitat/).

Once you have downloaded it, follow the instructions on the page for your specific operating system.

If you are running macOS and use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), you can use our official [Homebrew tap](https://github.com/habitat-sh/homebrew-habitat).
```
$ brew tap habitat-sh/habitat
$ brew install hab
```

If you are running Windows and use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org), you can install our [chocolatey package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/habitat)
```
C:\> choco install habitat
```

If you do _not_ run Homebrew or Chocolatey, or if you use Linux, you can use the [Habitat install
script](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/blob/master/components/hab/install.sh) from a bash shell.

```
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/habitat-sh/habitat/master/components/hab/install.sh | sudo bash
```
