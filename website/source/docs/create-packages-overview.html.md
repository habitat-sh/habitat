# Create Packages
Packages are the artifacts that are uploaded, downloaded, unpacked, and installed in Habitat. They are built from shell scripts known as plans, but may also include runtime hooks and service configuration files that describe the behavior and configuration of a running package payload. More conceptual information on packages and artifacts can be found in the [Packages and artifacts concept topic](/docs/concepts-packages/).

This section is divided into the following areas:

- [Create plans](/docs/create-plans/): Describes what a plan is and how to create one.
- [Add configuration to plans](/docs/configure-packages/): Learn how to make your running service configurable by templatizing configuration files in your plan.
- [Plan syntax guide](/docs/plan-syntax/): Lists the settings, variables, and functions that you can use when creating your plan.
