# Consult `.bldr.toml` to figure out which files we care about for the
# given package.

# Requires `rq` and `jq` to be installed for TOML parsing

# Given input TOML like this:
#
#    [hab-sup]
#    plan_path = "components/habitat/sup"
#    paths = [
#      "components/habitat/sup/*",
#      "components/habitat/eventsrv-client/*",
#      "components/habitat/launcher-client/*",
#      "components/habitat/butterfly/*",
#      "components/habitat/core/*",
#      "components/builder/builder-depot-client/*",
#    ]
#
# we extract the plan path and turn it into a regex that matches that
# root directory (i.e., given `components/habitat/sup`, create
# `components/habitat/sup/*`), then merge that in with all the other paths we
# care about. Then, we ensure they're all unique, and then create one
# big regex by joining it all together with `|`
#
# Thus we are left with:
#
#    components/builder/builder-depot-client/*|components/habitat/butterfly/*|components/habitat/core/*|components/habitat/eventsrv-client/*|components/habitat/launcher-client/*|components/habitat/sup/*
#
# (Note: I wanted to do this with just `rq`, but I couldn't find a way
# to join the *modified* `plan_path` together with the contents of
# `path. Thus, all it's doing here is converting TOML to JSON so we
# can use `jq`'s more flexible language to process the data. `jq` can
# also output raw strings, so we don't need a `tr -d '"'` tacked on to
# the end.)
