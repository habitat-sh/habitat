# Releasing Habitat

This document contains step-by-step details for how to release Habitat. All components are released
from the master branch on a bi-weekly schedule occurring every other Thursday.

## Submit a Release Notes Blog Post PR

If one has not already been opened, create a "Release Notes" blog post PR. Add a file to the Habitat repo: `www/source/blog/2018-02-20-0540Release.html.md`. Of course you will change the date and version to match the reality that is manifesting itself in your present moment. This post should begin with the following structure:

```
---
title: Habitat <VERSION> Released
date: <yyyy-mm-dd>
author: Tasha Drew
tags: release notes
category: product
classes: body-article

Habitat <VERSION> Release Notes

We are happy to announce the release of Habitat <VERSION>. We have a number of new features as well as bug fixes, so please read on for all the details. If you just want the binaries, head on over to [Install Habitat](https://www.habitat.sh/docs/using-habitat/#install-habitat). Thanks again for using Habitat!

Highlights:
* [BREAKING CHANGE] SOME BREAKING CHANGE
```

If you happen to be aware of features or bugs and feel there are user impacting words that need to be expressed, this is your opportunity to express them. Tasha will finalize and publish this PR after the release process is complete.

**Important:** Filter all closed PRs labeled `C-breaking` and ensure any and all of these PRs is mentioned as a `[BREAKING CHANGE]` in the post highlights.

## Prepare Master Branch for Release

1. Clone the Habitat repository if you do not already have it

    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:habitat-sh/habitat.git ~/habitat
    ```

1. Ensure you are on the master branch and have the latest of `~/habitat`

    ```
    $ cd ~/habitat
    $ git checkout master
    $ git pull origin master
    ```

1. Create a new release branch in the Habitat repo

    ```
    $ cd ~/habitat
    $ git checkout -b <branch>
    ```

1. Remove the `-dev` suffix from the version number found in the `VERSION` file

    ```
    $ sed -i '' -e 's/-dev//' VERSION
    ```

1. Generate a new `CHANGELOG.md`

    ```
    $ export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-token>
    $ make changelog
    ```

The changelog generator will only process the last 1000 issues to prevent the generator from exceeding Github's rate limit threshold. This may produce a truncated changelog. If so, simply copy the last release in the generated changelog and paste it on top of the former changelog. Terrible we know but we have a better plan coming!

1. Commit the `CHANGELOG.md` and `VERSION` changes and push your branch
1. Issue a new PR await approval (in the form of a [dank gif](http://imgur.com/X0sNq)) from two maintainers
1. Pull master once again once the PR is merged into master
1. Create & push a Git tag

    ```
    $ make tag-release
    $ git push origin --tags
    ```

Once the release tag is pushed, Travis and Appveyor builds will be triggered on the release tag. There is currently a bug where if multiple mac builds are running concurrently, one build can possibly delete some hab keys needed by the other. Until this is propperly addressed, **kill any travis builds running that are NOT part of the release tag build**.

The release tag builds will upload all release binaries to a channel named `rc-[VERSION]` and the hab cli will be uploaded BUT not published to the `stable` bintray repository. These builds can take nearly an hour to fully complete. Keep an eye on them so we can validate the binaries when they finish.

## Validate the Release

For each platform, download the latest stable cli version from [Bintray](https://bintray.com/habitat/stable). These can be downloaded from the version files page but are unpublished so that our download page does not yet include them. There may be special behavior related to this release that you will want to validate but at the very least, run `hab studio enter` and make sure:

Due to historical contingincies, evaluating the release is currently a bit tricky.

You need to set `HAB_INTERNAL_BLDR_CHANNEL` and `CI_OVERRIDE_CHANNEL` to the name of the release channel (you _may_ also need to set `HAB_STUDIO_SECRET_HAB_INTERNAL_BLDR_CHANNEL` and `HAB_STUDIO_SECRET_CI_OVERRIDE_CHANNEL`). If a new Launcher is in the release channel, you should be fine; however, since that should be rare, you may have some additional work.

In a previous release, we were able to validate things on Linux by re-using a chroot studio and installing a Launcher out-of-band. You can probably create a new studio, enter it with `HAB_STUDIO_SUP=false`, manually install the latest stable Launcher (if a new one isn't part of the current release), exit the studio, then re-enter with `HAB_STUDIO_SUP` unset (but with all the override variables mentioned above set). This should reuse the Launcher you just installed, but pull in additional artifacts as needed from your release channel.

See https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/issues/4656 for further context and ideas.

Then you can actually exercise the software as follows:

1. It pulls down the correct studio image
1. That studio's `hab` is at the correct version
1. A `sup-log` shows a running supervisor and the supervisor is the correct version

When testing the linux studio, you will need to `export CI_OVERRIDE_CHANNEL` to the rc channel of the release. So if you are releasing 0.75.2, the channel would be `rc-0.75.2`.

### Addressing issues with a release

If you find issues when validating the release binaries that must be fixed before promoting the release, you will need to fix those issues and then have Travis and Appveyor rerun the deployment. After you merge the necessary PRs to fix the release issues:

1. Delete the local release tag: `git tag -d <tag>`
2. Delete the remote tag: `git push origin :<tag>`
3. Tag the release again: `make tag-release`
4. Push that tag: git push origin --tags

## Publish the release

```
$ export HAB_AUTH_TOKEN=<your-token>
$ export BINTRAY_USER=<your-bintray-user>
$ export BINTRAY_KEY=<your-bintray-api-key>
$ make publish-release
```

This should promote all RC packages to stable and publish the hab cli for each platform (linux, mac and windows).

Note that if you end up re pushing a release to address issues with a release, you may receive the error:

```
There are multipe pages of releases. Consider deleting the channel and then rebuild.
```

Our bash promote script is not sophisticated enough to page through results. The best option here is to `destroy` the rc channel.

```
hab bldr channel destroy -o core rc-0.75.2
```

Then re push the release tag.

## Update Builder Bootstrap Bundle

Once the travis linux deployment has completed, we generate a release bundle of all Habitat and Builder components which are uploaded to an S3 bucket which we read from when we bootstrap new nodes. This bundle is useful if you are bootstrapping in an environment which doesn't have access to Builder or there simply isn't a Builder instance in existence (ah, those were the days).

1. Configure your AWS credentials in your environment
1. Run the bundle build make task

    ```
    $ make bundle
    ```

## Update Homebrew Tap

We have our own [Homebrew tap](https://github.com/habitat-sh/homebrew-habitat) that will need
updating. You will need the following bits of information for the latest stable MacOS Bintray artifact:

* the new version number
* the new release
* the SHA256 of the Bintray zip file

With those in hand, update the
[formula](https://github.com/habitat-sh/homebrew-habitat/blob/5adccfd7bf7657e64abda659160ca116d8bdff1a/Formula/hab.rb#L3-L5),
and merge the changes to the master branch.

(This will be a temporary state of affairs; I'll be talking with Engineering Services soon to get their help with automating this, as well as other parts of our release process.)

## Publish Release

Create release in [GitHub](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/releases)

On the Github releases page, there should already be a tag for the release (pushed up previously).
Draft a new Release, specify the tag, and title it with the same (eg, 0.18.0). Then hit Publish Release.

## Update the Acceptance environment with the new hab-backline

After the new hab is released and there is a new hab-backline in stable, the acceptance environment will also need to be updated. In order to do this, the simplest steps (from a Linux machine) are:

```
sudo hab pkg install core/hab-backline/<latest version>
cd /hab/cache/artifacts
hab pkg upload -u https://bldr.acceptance.habitat.sh -c stable -z <AUTH_TOKEN> core-hab-backline-<latest version>-x86_64-linux.hart

```

*Important*: Don't forget to include the `-c stable` in the upload step above!

# Drink. It. In.

## Bump Version

1. Update the version number found in the `VERSION` file to the next target release and append the `-dev` suffix to that number
1. Issue a PR and merge it yourself

> Example: If the release version was `0.9.0` then the contents of `VERSION` might read `0.10.0-dev` if your next target is `0.10.0`.

## Update the Acceptance environment with the new hab-backline

Now there's yet another new version of hab-backline, in unstable. So off to the races again for acceptance. This time you'll install the hab backline from _unstable_ channel.  The other steps are the same:

```
sudo hab pkg install -c unstable core/hab-backline
cd /hab/cache/artifacts
hab pkg upload -u https://bldr.acceptance.habitat.sh -c stable -z <AUTH_TOKEN> core-hab-backline-<latest version>-x86_64-linux.hart

```

*Important*: Don't forget to include the `-c stable` in the upload step above!

# Troubleshooting Mac deployments

Travis runs the Mac deployment scripts via SSH to a headless Mac builder affectionately called `74.80.245.236`. You can SSH to this machine as `admin` using the `habitat-srv-admin` key available in 1password.

If the mac build fails complaining it is out of space, the best course of action is to run:

```
rm -rf $HOME/code/*
```

This will clean up any orphaned working directories from previous failed and canceled builds.

# If your Release is going to cause downtime

1. Put a scheduled maintanence window into PagerDuty so the on-call doesn't go off.
1. Pre-announce outage on Twitter & Slack #general channel. There is no hard rule for a length of time you need to do this ahead of a release outage.
1. When your release begins, post announcement in our statuspage.io with outage information.
1. Per [ON_CALL.md](#ON_CALL.md) you are responsible for updating status changes in statuspage.io as the downtime proceeds. You are not responsible for regular minutes or responding in any other venue.
1. When the downtime is over, announce the end of the outage via statuspage.io. It will automatically post an announcement to #general and twitter.

# Release Notification

1. Create a new post in [Habitat Announcements](https://discourse.chef.io/c/habitat)
1. Link forum post to the github release
1. Link github release to forum post
1. Tweet a link to the announcement @habitatsh
