# and self-consistent packages in Builder for all to use. If we did S3
# first, but the following Builder promotion failed for some reason,
# people getting packages from our "curlbash" installer would get a
# new `hab`, but wouldn't be able to get the rest of the packages
# (easily, anyway), because they wouldn't have yet made it to the
# stable channel.
