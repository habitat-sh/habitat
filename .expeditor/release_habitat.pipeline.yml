  # It is VERY IMPORTANT that Docker container uploads ARE NOT active
  # in manually-triggered pipeline runs (at least, not without GREAT
  # CARE and knowledge of *exactly* what you are doing.)
  #
  # The issue is that they are tagged according to the current version
  # (i.e., the VERSION file). If you manually trigger this pipeline,
  # chances are you're doing it on a PR. Imagine that your PR happens
  # to be branched off of master at the last stable release. As a
  # result, it will have the same version as what is currently
  # released. Were you to upload to DockerHub, you would end up
  # overwriting the existing container with your new one, containing
  # who knows what.
  #
  # Until we no longer have such tight version coupling with the
  # studio and / or we get an internal container registry to push
  # pre-release container images to, these steps should only be
  # executed during "real" runs of this pipeline.
