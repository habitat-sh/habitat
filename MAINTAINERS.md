# Maintainers

Habitat is an open-source project, built and maintained by a community of
dedicated humans, listed below.

This file lists how the Habitat project is maintained and the humans and
companies who make up "The Habitat Maintainers."

When making changes to the system, this file tells you who needs to review your
patch - you need approval of at least one maintainer for the relevant subsystems
to provide a :+1: (or `+r`) on your pull request. Additionally, you need to not
receive a veto from a Lieutenant or the Project Lead.

Check out the [Maintenance Policy](maintenance-policy.md) for details on the
process, how to become a maintainer, lieutenant, or the project lead.
