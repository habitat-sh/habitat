# Maintainers

Habitat is an open-source project, built and maintained by a community of
dedicated humans, listed below.

In the source files, you will see a copyright notice attributed to "The Habitat
Maintainers"; this is a placeholder for all the people and organizations listed
in this file.

Regardless of their presence in this file, each individual contributor retains
their copyright to their work, and is covered in the blanket "The Habitat
Maintainers" statement.

This file lists how the Habitat project is maintained. When making changes to
the system, this file tells you who needs to review your patch - you need
approval of at least one maintainer for the relevant subsystems to provide a
:+1: (or `+r`) on your pull request. Additionally, you need to not receive a
veto from a Lieutenant or the Project Lead.

Check out the [Maintenance Policy](maintenance-policy.md) for details on the
process, how to become a maintainer, lieutenant, or the project lead.
